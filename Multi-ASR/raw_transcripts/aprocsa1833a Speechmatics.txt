Not very good that's that's my take on it I can't think I can't say what I want to and spelling is just like I had to ask old ask at the phone were whatever her name was to spell guard G but I couldn't spell it and simple words simple words I can't think of it but I if I had look up a dictionary or it light will go off and I will be able to spell it but but to think of it I can't even I still still struggle to text because I can't think of the right spelling not spelling and spelling and and word phrase so she gets aggravated oh yeah well well the the initial one I remember we always kissed before we go to bed and well she said that I didn't pucker is just you know right here and and I said well well over and over again I couldn't I couldn't say just well and And I I remember that the right up to the gas station for the er I remember going in but that was the last thing I remember until I woke up in Vanderbilt ambulance I just I was scared because I couldn't communicate and I had a deep depression so and I had had to train all over again just to brush my teeth so it was just I guess that surgeon said that you know the the cluster of vessels right here and it burst and so I I I wanted to when they released me I wanted to drive but anyway yeah and every time I talk at least if we're conversation right here you know the the I don't know you and right here I am sweating and I don't I didn't I didn't do that before the stroke and so just to know that my my glasses fogged up and I am starting to sweat yep but but the my friend if we have to talk a lengthy I started to sweat too but just like if I was going to lows I mean I mean just just to I think I was embarrassed I was even embarrassed to communicate because you know I stumble and and can't think of the words and and so every time I do that sweat so but anyway you know well the speech therapist at Tennova but that was I think it was six months so but the insurance cut me off no I don't think so was that well it was still a challenge even even though got I don't know it was September I got home something like that so it still had had to learn all over again I don't know well she had me read and and say say the dumbest things over and over and over was I don't know just a five you know four four words over and over again then five or I mean six talking she said it and then I said well the that sentence and and I had to repeat I don't know do what I do my my dad was a preacher and she she he went to Flint Michigan from Florence Alabama and in January of 67 and we're she he preached at her parents was converted and so I seeked her out but well I was in Henderson Tennessee going to Freed-hardeman College and that was a college there then it's not now the university but the she was still in Flint Michigan so that had a long distance relationship so and I started out preaching and but but her dad was in General Motors and he was a grinder skilled trades and he said that the shops were hiring but the shop he the sharps weren't hiring as well as he he thought and we took we went up there in January of 73 and and and I got in July 31st so but that was a good move because we had retirement and the General Motors stopped that retirement in probably oh seven or oh eight and I retired in Oh three that was a good move I just didn't want to be like my dad because preachers don't you have don't have a retirement you go to work or you die and if if the they don't have benefits and so you could had to probably hold down two jobs for benefits so I just I decided not to go along those lines I am thankful so and and and the bill brain surgery is half a million and the we only paid just over $1,000 well but Medicaid and Blue Cross you know oh yeah Medicare and Blue Cross paid for that yeah if I had had to be a preacher he's going to that's right my glasses are fogging up I made myself nervous well what do you mean to tell your story the boy was kicking the ball and and it goes through the window and he lands on his father and his father throws it back at him or are you going to discipline him yes well no well first one picture is probably a child don't want the umbrella and momma said that you need an umbrella and The probably they said the child you don't need one so he he goes out in the rain and he gets wet and goes back and gets the the umbrella so he can get dry real good well it was probably the little girl had the cat and the dog chased him up the tree and dad got up on the tree and he lost his ladder and and he was probably afraid to the drop get down and the fireman had to be called to get the dad and the cat down somewhat about that I can't probably get the words out so I don't know if his mother or stepmother or two two sisters or their ugly and and Cinderella's beautiful to him but they are into themselves and my stepmother treats the other girls nice and taking to parties and Cinderella had to scrub the floors and she was a stepmother who was harsh and so Fairy Godmother comes into view and helps her out and turns a pumpkin into the chariot and horses and anyway animals and had glass slippers and and she went to the ball and met the prince and she had she was late and the pumpkin turned out turned back in and and horses and men so so the prince tried to get the youngers women to Try on the slipper and the two ugly sisters the the feet they tried to get stick in their feet to the slipper and so Cinderella had had a fit to the slipper and lived happily ever get the bread get the peanut butter and jar and jelly jelly jar and get the knife and spread on the peanut butter and get a spoon and dig out the jelly and and spoon it on the bread and and eat it that's right
