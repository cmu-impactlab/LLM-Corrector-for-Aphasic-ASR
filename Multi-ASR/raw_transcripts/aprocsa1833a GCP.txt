not very good that's that's my take on it i can't think i can't say what i want to know and spelling is um just like i had to ask oh ask it the um the phone where where whatever her name it was to um
spell guard g u a r d but i couldn't spell and uh simple words simple words are i can't think of it and but i uh uh if i had um look it up in dictionary or um it light will go off and uh um i won't be all able to spell it but uh
but to think of it i can't even i still still struggle to text because i can't think of the right um spelling not spelling spelling and and word phrase so she gets aggravated so yeah well the the initial one i remember
we always kiss before we go to bed and well she said that i didn't pucker is just you know right here and and i said well well over it and over it again i
i couldn't i couldn't say just what and uh and i i remember that the ride up to the gas station for the er i remember going in but that was the last thing i remember until i woke up in the vanderbilt ambulance i just uh
i was scared because i couldn't communicate and had a deep depression so and i had had to train all over again just to brush my teeth so it was just i guess that surgeon said that you know the cluster of vessels right here and
it burst and so that i i i wanted to when released me i i wanted to drive but anyway yeah and uh uh every time um i talk at least if we're conversation right here and you know uh
the the i don't know you and right here i am sweating and i i didn't i didn't do that before the stroke and uh so just to know that my my glasses fogged up and i i am starting to sweat yep but uh but the uh
my friend if we have could talk lengthy i i start to start to sweat too but just like if i was going to lows i mean just just to i think i was i was even i embarrassed to communicate because you know i have stumbled and
and king thinks the words and and so every time i do that sweat you know so but anyway you know well the speech therapist at tenova but that was i think it was six months so but the insurance cut cut me off i don't think so was it it was still a challenge even even though uh
got to i don't know was it september i got home something like that so it's still had had to learn all over again
yeah well she had me read and say say the dumbest things over and over and over well i don't know just that five you know four four words over and over again and five or i mean
that sentence and and i had to uh repeat i don't know do that i do my uh my dad was a preacher and she uh not she he um went to uh flint michigan from uh
florence alabama and uh uh in january of 67 and uh where uh she uh he preached that her parents was converted and uh um so i i seeked her out but it well i was in uh henderson tennessee going to uh free heart of
in college and it was a college there then it's not now it's a university but um the uh she was still in flint michigan so that had a long distance relationship so and i i started out preaching and uh but uh um but her dad was uh
in general motors he was a grinder of skill trades and he said that the shops were hiring but the shop he the shops weren't hiring as what else is he he thought and we took we went out up there in january
73 and and and i get out in july 31st so but that was a good move because we had retirement and um the general motors stopped that retirement in
probably 007 or 08 and i retired in uh 03 that was a a good move i just didn't want to uh uh be uh like my dad because uh preachers all don't um you have don't have a retirement because at work you die and if if they uh they don't
don't have uh benefits and so you could had to probably hold down two jobs for benefits so i just i decided not to go along those lines i am thankful so and and and the bill brain surgery is half of me and and and the
uh we we only paid uh just over $1,000 well but medicaid and um blue cross you know oh yeah medicare and blue cross paid for that yeah if i had had to be a preacher is he's going to that's right my glasses are fogging out i'm may make myself nervous well what do you mean i tell you story the boy
just kicking the ball and and uh it goes through uh the uh window and he lends on his father and his father throws it back and or or you going to discipline him yes well no well first one that pictures uh probably um the child uh um don't want uh
the umbrella and mama said that you need the umbrella and probably they said the child you don't
don't need one so he uh he goes out and the rain and he gets wet and uh goes back and gets the uh the umbrella so so she he can get dry really good well this probably the little girl had uh
the cat and the dog chased him up the tree and dad got up on the tree and he lost his ladder and he's probably doesn't afraid to drop get down and the farmer had to be called to get the dad and the cat down
i can't probably that get the words out cinderella's i don't know if his mother or stepmother or anyway two two sisters are they're ugly and and cinderella's beautiful so but they are into themselves and
um my stepmother treats the other girls nice and um taking the parties and cinderella had to uh scrub the floors and um and she was a stepmother who was hard
and so very good my mother comes in the view and helps her out and turns a pumpkin into the chariot and uh horses and anyway animals and have glass slippers and
and she went to the ball and met the prince and she had she was late and the pumpkin turned out turned back in and and horses and men so all the prince tried to get the
younger's women to uh try on the slipper and uh the uh two ugly uh sisters the um the feet they they tried to uh get stick in their feet to the slipper and uh so cinderella um had had a fit
to the slipper and live that happy to have it ever get the red bread get the peanut butter and jar and jelly jelly jar and get the knife spread on the peanut butter and get a spoon and dig out the jelly and
spoon is on the bread and and eat it that's right
