Okay. Well, I don't, I don't think it, it, as for my stroke, my first stroke was okay. I, I, at first I didn't... couldn't say anything and then I went up, and up and took, took therapy, speech therapy and when not... I got, got it back and, uh, now, uh, with the second stroke I, I have, I have some times when I wanna say something and I can't say it and then w- w- way, way away, "Oh yeah, I, I said it." You know? So, I had to, had to work on that. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. I, I was, I wa- my first stroke, I didn't h- I didn't know what it was, but I knew I was feeling, you know, s- uneasy and, and stuff and, and then I... it, it came on me. And now, on my second stroke, I, I, I, I figured it was, uh, another one and so, um, I knew some of the things I had to go do. It was that saying, so I, I, I, I be-... I think I would say the second stroke because I... it was rec- you know, well, recently than the first one. And, uh, and then I, I had it and I went to, uh, uh, the, uh... went to a ho- a hospital that... one here, uh, the, um... it was the one that, uh... it was... h- I wanted to say I, I stayed in the ho- hospital and I went to therapy.

And, uh, I went, I went to fa- uh, to bathe myself, learn how to bathe myself and, uh, um, and o- OT I was, um... I would have some, uh, some exercises to, uh, have it so I wo- I could do my hand and s- stuff. PT, I learned how to walk again. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And on the, on the first stroke, I, I, I came here too at the... at, at p-... what's, what's the name of the... uh-huh, the Pi Beta... Pi Beta... What is it? The last... Yeah, I had my stro- uh, my, uh, P- uh, PT, speaks and, uh, what is it? Speech, OT and PT here and I, I had... and it's very good. I had... That's what I say. I get all the way up and then I, I joined the, the, the, um... what? Uh, the thing that I want... uh, I joined... you know what I... you know I want... I knew... I wanted to say it. I joined it then and I've been in there all the way. And I, I have been in there about f- longer than anybody else. Yeah. We had a, a banquet and, uh, I, I got the, a little plaque for that. Mm-hmm. With some, some people had died and stuff like that, but I was s- s- still the l- the longest one there, but somebody, s- other b- other people had joined, just joined or has had s- more than other people, but I w- had more than all of them. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And, uh... so, you know. And, and th- that's... I, I was very... I was very proud of that. Mm-hmm. For all of your commitment to it. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And, uh, they had er- they gave me a wand. I had been in the book club longer than anybody. Mm-hmm. Oh. Every- Oh, um... I had one... I had my first, uh, baby, it was a girl. Uh-huh. And I wa- I, I, I had it and, and I wa- I was very good, uh, good wo- my t- I thought I had a, uh, I was a good mother in doing things for...... her. It was a joy to do that and now she is, uh, 40, 45 years, uh, 7, 47 years old. But, uh, I remember this. That's one of the things that I ha- I had in my life. Right. No. Not like that. You get a, you get old and then I say, "I'm, I'm 4-, I'm 71." I guess you are that, that old. When a, a, a boy, he is, uh, th- uh, 30. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. The bo- uh, the little boy is playing soccer and he's playing ha- happy. And then, uh, he say he, he, he, he kicked the ball and the, the wi- the window, the neighbor's window broke 'cause he kicked it through the window. And then, the, the man was sitting in the living room and, uh, the, that ball, um, came through and, and he, he was shocked. And the, the, uh, the lamp fell over and stuff. And then, he got up and he said, "It's a soccer ball." And he looked out the window to see who ki- he kicked it. Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Oh. Th- this little, this little boy or little girl, they, the, uh, it look like a ba- uh, he look like a b- a girl. Um. . But he's going to school and his mama said, "Take this, uh, umbrella because it looks like rain." And he said, "I don't wanna... I don't wanna take that. I might l- lose it. It's not raining." And s- and ha- as he goes to school, it started to rain and it rained and ra- and then, he came back and he looked, he was all wet. And his mother said, "Didn't I tell you to take the umbrella?" And so, he got the umbrella and he started back to school. Mm-hmm. Okay, okay. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, wait. The ca- the li- girl got a, a cat that up and up, hi, the cat is up in the tree. And so, he said, "Please get my cat." And, uh, and she was riding on her pi- uh, tricycle and she ride, tried to get the cat down, but he wouldn't go. And then so, he, he, he t- uh, asked the man to get it down with the ladder, but he didn't make it. He's still up in the tree and the cat's up in the tree. And so, they called the fire department and, and, and the dog is, uh, barking for, at the man. But then, the fire department came and he, they got the c- the cat out of the tree. Yeah. There, there's a lot and then, and then mentioning the bird that's just sitting there looking. He can... That's all he was gonna do. Yeah. Um. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. This, this a story about Cinderella. He, he had, he h- her. Wait a minute. His daddy was a widow 'cause his wife died and he, she was very neat and pretty when she was a little girl. And then, then his mother, his daddy said, "I'm going to marry this woman." She was a, a very treacherous woman and she, and she wanted to marry him. So, he, they ma- they married and he, uh, she had two little girls. Very, um, very, very ugly girls. And, and, and so, then the, the daddy died and oh, she said she was gonna run the house. And she didn't want, uh, Cinderella to have pretty clothes. She will, she wanted her to have rags. And, and then she said, "I don't have a, a, a, a maid to run this house, so you will be the maid and you will run, be, be my, my maid, maid and the, the girls too." And then, by this time, they have grown up. And so she mi- she, uh, fixed the stu- the, uh, uh, the, the... Fixed the, um, the, um, the wood, the fire, and did the housework, and cooked the di- ba- breakfast and stuff for them. Anything they wanted, she had to do it. And so, she li- lived up in the attic and, and, and when sh- she had the animals to talk to her, the horse and the, the rats and, and the, uh, cat and things. That's all she had to talk to. And then, uh, uh...... a telegram came because the king wants hi- his son to marry, so he had a ball and so he could see, "Well, who will you want to marry?" But, uh, so, um, the- the two girls and- and their mother got some fancy clothes and everything to go to the- to the ball because, see, she wanted one of them to marry the prince. So, um, the mo- the mother had left a dress for her and say, "I will... I will use this- this, my mother's dress, and I- I will, uh, fix it up." And then when- when the, uh, the- the mother and the two girls, uh, wanted... had to get ready and dressed up and go to the ball, and then Cinderella came down and said, "I wanna go too," and oh, they was... They were very, very ugly. And they said, "Oh, you wanna go? You can't go." And then out- out... She ma- she ma- uh... Uh, the dress she had, she- they pitted... she pitted out, uh... they smashed it, I think. And so after they ha- had made the, uh, dress m- messy and torn and they went to the- to the ball and- and then, uh, the mo- uh, the mother put, uh, um... put, uh, uh, Cinderella upstairs, I think. And so, uh, she couldn't go out and then, uh, the- the, uh, the Fairy Godmother came and Cinderella looked and she... and- and- and her mother said... she told her, "They wouldn't let me go to the ball." And so she said, "Just a minute, I'll see about this." And so, um, uh, she got her a dress, a pretty dress, and- and made the- the pumpkin and the rats and the- the cats now, made them the, uh, footstalls and- and the driver and thing. And- and said, "You're going to the ball, but you must get back by 12 o'clock or all- all this I've fixed for you will- will be, um, um, be gone." And so they all went to the ball and Cinderella came and the- the- the old- old- old man... uh, the old man, the old, um... the old baddie was looking and the- and the girls were too. They said, "Who is that girl who's going- going at the ball?" And look at the princes looking at her. And so... And so, the prince danced with her for all of the night and- and so she wanted to know... He wanted to know who her... what her name is and where- where is she, but she didn't tell him. And then, as she had some pretty shoes, they were s- uh... they were glass shoes and so... And the- the clock was- was chiming 12 o'clock so that she gotta- gotta let go because she said that the Fairy Godmother said, "If you don't get out- out of there by 12, you'll have all that stuff... Y- y- i- i- it will go back." So she was going and running and running, and she... One of the, uh, um, shoes were left on- on the- the, uh, steps and she was running and running because she was, gotta get out of there. And the- the little... went back, the pumpkin and- and the- the rats and the... all the toys, they all went back to what they were. And so, then the- the girl. And so, um, uh, the- the old mother, uh, put her up in the- the, uh, in the... The- they came around her house and said, "Where is she at?"I wanted you to loo- uh, look to you to look at this shoe to see if you can wear it. And and, and the b- uh, uh, all girl- the other one, uh... So she said, "I was, I was f-f-fit it." But it didn't fit either. And then the sh- the, the other shoe and the, and the mo- and the mother's an- other shoe. And they found i- it was her. And so, they had a big wedding and they lived happy ever after. Yay. Uh- The best retelling of Cinderella I think I've heard. Oh, b- uh, you know, I, I will... I h- I was a teacher and I would tell all the kinda stories. Yeah. I was gonna ask if you ever told your students- Yeah. ... or your kids the Cinderella story. Yeah, kids and everything. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm sure they loved it when you did. Y- oh, yeah. Yeah.
