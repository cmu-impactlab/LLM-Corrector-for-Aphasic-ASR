not very good

that's my take on it

I can't say what I want to

yep

and spelling is

just like

I had to ask oh

oh shoot

the phone

whatever her name is

Siri

to spell guard

g u a r d

but I couldn't spell it

and simple words

simple words are

I can't think of it

but if I look it up in dictionary or light will go off

and I will be able to spell it

but to think of it I can't

I still struggle to text

because I can't think of the right spelling

spelling and word phrase

so

she gets aggravated

so oh yeah

well the initial one

we always kiss before we go to bed

well she said that I did a pucker

is just you know right here

and I said well well over and over again

I couldn't say

just well

and I remember the ride up to the gas station for the e r Tenova

I remember going in but that was last thing I ever remember until I woke up in Vanderbilt

ambulance

I just I was scared because I couldn't communicate

and I had a deep depression

so

and I had to train all over again just to brush my teeth

so

yeah I guess that surgeon said that you know the cluster of vessels right here

and it burst

and so that

but I wanted to when released me I wanted to drive

but anyway

yeah and every time I talk least at

if we're conversation right here

you know the

I don't know you

and right here I am sweating

and I didn't do that before the stroke

so just to know that my glasses fogged up

and I am starting to sweat

yep

but my friend if we have to talk lengthy I start to sweat too

but just like if I was going to Lowe's

I mean

I mean it's

just to

I think I was even I'm embarrassed to communicate

because you know I stumble and can't think of the words and

so every time I do that sweat gets

so

but anyway

you know I do

well the speech therapist at Tenova

I think it was six months

but the insurance cut me off

so

no

I don't think so

was that

well it was still a challenge

even though got

I don't know

was it September I got home

something like that

so still had to learn

all over again

yeah

I don't know where

well she had me read

and say the dumbest things over and over and over

but was

I don't know

just five you know four words over and over again

and then five four I mean six whatever

talking

she said it

and then I said it

well that sentence

and I had to repeat

I don't know

do what

I

my dad was a preacher

and she not she he went to Flint Michigan from Florence Alabama

and in January of sixty seven

where he preached at

her parents were converted

and so I seeked her out

well I was in Henderson Tennessee going to Freed Hardeman college

and that was a college there then

now it's a university

she was still in Flint Michigan

so that had a long distance relationship

so then I started out preaching

but her dad was in General Motors

and he was a grinder a skill trades

and he said that the shops were hiring

but the shops weren't hiring as well as he thought

and we took we went all up there in January of seventy three

and I get out in July thirty first of seventy three

but that was a good move because we had retirement

and the General Motors stopped that retirement in probably o seven or o eight

and I retired in o three

so that was a good move

yeah but I just didn't want to be like my dad because preachers don't have a retirement

you go to work and you die

and they don't have benefits

and so I had to hold down two jobs for benefits

so I decided not go along those lines

and I am thankful

so

and

the bill for brain surgery

it was half a million

and we only paid just over a thousand dollars

but Medicaid and Blue Cross you know paid

huh

oh yeah

yeah Medicare and Blue Cross paid for that

yep

yeah

if I had to be a preacher it's going

that's right

my glasses are fogging up

I'm making myself nervous

okay

well

what do you mean

tell you a story

the boy's kicking the ball

and it goes through the window

and it lands on his father

and his father throws it back at him

or

or he gonna discipline him

oh

yes

oh well

no

well first one the picture's probably a child don't want the umbrella

and mama said that you need a umbrella

and probably they said the child you don't need one

so he goes out in the rain

and he gets wet and goes back gets the umbrella so he could get dry

oh yes

well probably the little girl had the cat

and the dog chased him up the tree

and dad got up on the tree

and he lost his ladder

and he's probably afraid to get down

and the firemen had to be called to get the dad and the cat down

yeah I was somewhat mad

I can't probably get the words out

Cinderella's

I don't know if it was mother or stepmother or anyway

two sisters

or they're ugly

and Cinderella's beautiful too

but they are into themselves

and the stepmother treats the other girls nice and take them parties

and Cinderella had to scrub the floors

she was stepmother was harsh

so fairy godmother there comes in the view

and helps her out

and turns a pumpkin into the chariot and horses

and anyway animals

and have glass slippers

and she went to the ball and met the prince

and she was late

and the pumpkin turned out turned back in and the horses and the men

so the prince tried to get the younger women to try on the slipper

and the two ugly sisters

the feet

they tried to stick it in their feet to the slipper

so Cinderella had a fit to the slipper and lived happily after

so

get bread

get the peanut butter jar and jelly jar

and get the knife

and spread on the peanut butter

and get a spoon

and dig out the jelly

and the spoon is on the bread

and eat it

that's right
