okay

very erratic

I'm close to ten years since the stroke

and I've been more or less talking for the last seven

and at times this tenth year I can wake up and feel fine and pronounce things very carefully

other the times I'm off in the fall somewhere about back and forth more than of these past years

so anything else

yeah

it's late in December

I was alone in my small house

behind my a friend with my daughters

and I suddenly went

I would say at this point I'll say blank

but going back as far beyond this I couldn't get a hold of myself

and I was in the house

it was very cold

it's very messy

and I sat there from somewhere between two and three days

eventually my daughter came in

so

yeah it was very long

I couldn't move

I feel very more or less blessed by my recovery because I got up and moved eventually

months later

I couldn't walk for about I think three or four months

but I'm have been doing the things I was asked to do

and I read and I write

and I draw

and I walk a deal

and I'm doing yoga at this point about two or three times a week

oh okay

you look breathe brightly

yeah well one on one therapy

just sit down and

not exactly

it's more or less being connected to a aphasia

I've been in group but occasionally for two or three months at a time one on one
so

okay

just totally at random

okay

there's so many different things are important to me

I don't know really what to draw from

the every week is I experience them several things that are really mind bogglingly important

so

okay currently I've think I'm very concerned about the national political mood in this country

and I'm working I'm concentrated on something that I can do on a daily basis that takes the president out of office

and also I'm praying and talking with every people about it

so

that's very current and very important at the moment

so

yeah

not too many trips lately

I've been thinking about it a great deal

I am

maybe hoping to return to California

if another maybe one to two years

so

where

I'm

new no Media and Palos Verdes right near Redonda Beach

yeah

okay

by the way Redonda is among almost my favorite beach

long ago

there's three or four that's tied Redonda

in

I'll think about it

well it's second place

so I have to think about it

it's long ago

okay

it used to be very wide

I haven't been there for a while

so

yeah

yeah

It's since first cousin living on the beach in Hermosa Beach

so

okay

well the boy is kicking the ball

it's going through the window

it's dropping next to a young an older man who grabs it close

that's the basic

okay

I've been very busy lately

the young boy is has no umbrella from the mother

he says goodbye

goes out and it starts raining

he runs back

is all wet

the mother look at him a bit scoldingly

so he takes the umbrella and he walks to school

I guess

end of the story

okay

okay

okay and very basically the little girl is trying to reach the kittycat in the branches

there's a ladder and tricycle next to her

closer to the tree there's a forlorn looking man looking out as the dog barks up at him

and the two firemen are running with another ladder from the firetruck to presumably put the ladder up and rescue the man

and there's a bird sitting up and singing to the heavens

end of the story

was trying

close

yeah

the basics

yeah

okay

okay

okay

okay

simply put Cinderella was alarmingly pretty and good natured and in the servitude of an evil stepmother and two stepdaughters stepsisters

and really want the whole story right

okay

I got to keep awake

but I'll try

so there's a ball

and the mother and the sisters are very worked up about the whole thing and are gonna try on the best costumes

Cinderella was also worked up

but she is going to be

the mother is going to order to sit in the house and clean

so off the mother stepsisters go

and Cinderella is very forlorn

but all the household critters are gathered and send her off in a fancy gown

and I think it's a

what's the word

a good fairy appears to her

and becomes a mushroom sorry the pumpkin into a carriage

and off she goes to the ball

and naturally he is she is the first one of all

and various courtiers have told her that he has to return at midnight

so she has a great time dancing with the prince who is totally in love with her now

but the clock strikes ten sorry twelve

and she runs out the door and leaves one shoe in hall of the entrance

and he gets a carriage and rides home

and the carriage is carrying back into a pumpkin

and her gorgeous gown turns the old rags

and he returns to the day to day chores

and there's a back and forth about

the wicked stepmother and the stepsisters try to dress up and present themselves to the prince's emissaries

but I forget all the little details but

she appears at the nick of time

and the emissary puts the magic shoe on her

and everything is hunky dory

that's about it

okay

again and again I watched the whole damn thing for a little

like it's in my brain forever

yes

too bad

of course

okay go on

yeah

that's alright

I'll get bread sorry wheat bread

and put the jelly peanut butter on one side of the bread and the hopefully apricot jelly on the other side together

and eat it

yes
