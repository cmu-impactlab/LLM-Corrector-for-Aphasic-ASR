Okay. Well, I don't, I don't think it is for my stroke. My first stroke was okay. I, at first I didn't, couldn't say anything and then I went up and up and took therapy, speech therapy, and when I got it back. And now, but the second stroke, I, I have, I have some times when I want to say something and I can't say it and then way away. Oh yeah, I, I said it, you know, so I had to, had to work on that. Oh yeah, I, I was, I was, my first stroke, I didn't, I didn't know what it was, but I knew I was feeling, you know, uneasy and, and stuff, and, and then I, it, it came on me and now on my second stroke. I, I, I, I figured it was another one and so I knew some of the things I had to go through, it was the same, so I, I, I, I, I think I would say the second stroke because it was recent, you know, well, recent, then the first one. And then I, I had it and I went to the, the, uh, went to a hospital, that one here, it was the one that, I wanted to say it, I, I stayed in the hospital and I went to therapy. I went to speech and I went to OT and PT and I went, I went to, to raise myself, learn how to bathe myself and I know OT, I would have some exercises to have it so I could do my hand and stuff. PT, I learned how to walk again. Yeah, mhm. And on the, on the first stroke, I, I, I came here too at, at, at, what's, what's the name of the, Pieta, uh, Pi Beta, what is it, the last, yeah, I had my stroke, my PT, speech and OT and PT here, and I had, and it's very good. I had, that's what I say, I got all the way up and then I, I joined the, the, the, what, the thing that I want, that I joined, you know, what, you know, I want, I know I want to say it. I joined it then and I've been in that all the way and I, I have been in there about longer than anybody else. We had a, a banquet and I, I got a little plaque for that, but some, some people had died and stuff like that, but I was still the, the longest one there, but somebody, other, other people had joined this year, joined or had more than other people, but I had more than all of them. So, you know, and, and that's, I, I was very, I was very proud of that. And they gave me one. I had been in the book club longer than anybody. I had, I had my first baby, it was a girl and I, I, I, I had her and, and I, I was very good, my, I thought I had, I was a good mother and doing things for her. It was a joy to do that and now she is forty, forty-five years, seven, forty-seven years old, but I remember that, that's one of the things that I had in my life. No, I looked at you, you that old? And then I said, I'm, I'm seventy-one, I guess you are that old. A boy, he is thirty, yeah, the little boy is playing soccer and he's playing and then he said, he, he, he kicked the ball and the, the, the window, the neighbor's window broke because he kicked it through the window and then the man was sitting in the living room and the ball came through and he was shocked and the lamp fell over and stuff and then he got up and he said, it's a soccer ball, and he looked out the window to see who he kicked it. Oh yeah, okay, okay. The little boy or little girl, it looked like a girl, but he's going to school and his mama said, take this umbrella because it looks like rain. And he said, I don't want to, I don't want to take that, I might lose it, it's not raining, and as he goes to school, it started to rain and it rained and then he came back and he looked, he was all wet and his mother said, didn't I tell you to take the umbrella? And so he got the umbrella and he started back to school. Okay. The little girl got a cat that up and up, the cat is up in the tree and so he said, please get my cat and she was riding on her tricycle and she tried to get the cat down, but he wouldn't go and then so he, he, he asked the man to get it down with the ladder, but he didn't make it, he's still up in the tree and the cat's up in the tree. And so they called the fire department and the dog is barking for the man, but then the fire department came and they got the cat out of the tree. Yeah, they, they was a lot, I didn't mention the bird, just sitting there looking, that's all he was gonna do. Okay. It's, it's a story about Cinderella. He, he had her, I mean, his daddy was a widow because his wife died and he, she was very neat and pretty when she was a little girl, and then his mother, his daddy said, I'm going to marry this woman. She was a very treacherous woman, and she wanted to marry him, so they married and she had two little girls, very, very ugly girls and so then daddy died and all. She said she was gonna run the house and she didn't want Cinderella to have pretty clothes. She wanted her to have rags and then she said, I don't have a maid to run this house, so you will be the maid and you will be my maid and the girls too, and then by this time they had grown up and so she fixed the wood, the fire, and did her housework and cooked the breakfast and stuff for them. Anything they wanted, she had to do it and so she lived up in the attic and when she had the animals to talk to her, the horse and the rats and the cat and things, that's all she had to talk to. And then a telegram came because the king wants his son to marry, so he had a ball and so he tried to see who he want to marry, but so the two girls and the mother got some fancy clothes and everything to go to the ball because she wanted one of them to marry the prince. So the mother had left a dress for her and she said, I will, I will use this, this, my mother's dress and I will fix it up and then when the mother and two girls had to get ready and dressed up and go to the ball and then Cinderella came down, I said I want to go too, and all they was, they were very, very ugly and said, oh, you want to go, you can't go. And she, she, the dress she had, they smashed it. After they had made the dress messy and torn, and they went to the ball and then the mother put Cinderella upstairs, I think, so she couldn't go out and then the fairy godmother came and Cinderella looked and she told they wouldn't let me go to the ball, and so she said, just a minute, I'll see about this. She got her dress, a pretty dress, and made the pumpkin and the rats and the cat, made them the footstool and the driver and thing and so you go into the ball, but you must get back by twelve o'clock, all this fixed for you will be gone, and so they all went to the ball and Cinderella came and the old, old, old me at the, the old battles was looking and the girls were too. They said, where's that girl going at the ball and looking at her and so the prince danced with her for all the night and he wanted to know what her name is and where is she, but she didn't tell her and then she had some pretty shoes, they were glass shoes and the clock was time and twelve o'clock so she gotta, gotta let go because the fairy godmother said, if you don't get out there by twelve, all that stuff will go back. So she was going and running and running and one of the shoes were left on the steps and she was running and running cause she gotta get out of there and went back to pumpkin and the rats and the horse, they all went back to what they were. And so then the girl and so the old mother put her up in the, they came around her house and said, I wanted you to look at this shoe to see if you can wear it and the ugly other one, so she said, I will, I will fit it, but it didn't fit either. And then the other shoe and the mother, the other shoe, and they found it was her. And so they had a big wedding and they lived happily ever after. Yeah, best of Cinderella, I think, you know, I was a teacher and I would tell all kind of, yeah, the kids and, yeah. Oh yeah. Thank you. You even reminded me of some details that I forgot. Alright, yeah. Okay, I have one more thing for you, and then we're going to do the language test and then just a couple more things, okay, so this is going to be a little bit different. I want you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Oh, okay. Alright, you, you, you get the cabinet and you get some bread, two pieces of bread out of the, the, the bread is in the, what is it, the bread stayed in, and so the peanut butter and the two pieces of bread and okay, you get a piece of bread and you, oh, you need a knife and then you put, and then you put the bread and you put another, the other piece on the peanut butter and then you ate it. Yeah, that's the way I think I say it.
