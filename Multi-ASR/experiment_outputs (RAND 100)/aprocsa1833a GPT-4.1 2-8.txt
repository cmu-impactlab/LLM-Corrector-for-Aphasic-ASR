Not very good. That's, that's my take on it. I can't think I can't say what I want to, and spelling is just like I had to ask, the phone, whatever her name was, to spell guard, G U A R D, but I couldn't spell it and simple words, simple words, I can't think of it, but I, if I had, look it up in dictionary or light will go off and I won't be able to spell it, but to think of it, I can't even, I still, still struggle to text because I can't think of the right spelling, not spelling, and spelling and word phrase. She gets aggravated. Well, the initial one I remember, we always kissed before we go to bed and well, she said that I didn't pucker, just, you know, right here, and I said, well, well, over and over again, I couldn't, I couldn't. And I remember that the ride up to the gas station for the ER, I remember going in, but that was the last thing I remember until I woke up in Vanderbilt ambulance. I just, I was scared because I couldn't communicate and I had a deep depression, so I had had to train all over again just to brush my teeth. So, I guess that surgeon said that, you know, the cluster of vessels right here, and it burst and so I, I, I wanted to, when they released me, I wanted to drive. But anyway, yeah, and every time I talk, at least if we're conversation right here, you know, the, I don't know, you and right here I am sweating and I didn't, I didn't do that before the stroke and so just to know that my, my glasses fogged up and I am starting to sweat. But the, my friend, if we have to talk a lengthy, I started to sweat too, but just like if I was going to Lowe's, I mean, I mean, just, just to, I think I was, I was even embarrassed to communicate because, you know, I stumble and can't think of the words and so every time I do that, sweat. So but anyway, you know, well, the speech therapist at Tennova, but that was, I think it was six months, so but the insurance cut me off. No, I don't think so, was it? Well, it was still a challenge, even though, I don't know, it was in September, I got home, something like that, so it still had had to learn all over again. Well, she had me read and say, say the dumbest things over and over and over. I don't know, just a five, you know, four four words over and over again, then five or I mean six talking. She said it and then I said, well, the sentence and I had to repeat, I don't know, do that. I do, my dad was a preacher and she, he went to Flint, Michigan from Florence, Alabama, and in January of sixty-seven and he preached that her parents was converted and so I seeked her out, but well, I was in Henderson, Tennessee, going to Freed-Hardeman College and it was a college there then, it's not now, it's a university, but she was still in Flint, Michigan, so that had a long distance relationship, so and I started out preaching and but her dad was in General Motors and he was a grinder, skilled trades, and he said that the shops were hiring, but the shops weren't hiring as well as he thought, and we went up there in January of seventy-three and I got out in July thirty-first, so but that was a good move because we had retirement and the General Motors stopped that retirement in probably oh seven or oh eight, and I retired in oh three. That was a good move. I just didn't want to be like my dad, because preachers don't, you don't have a retirement, you go to work or you die, and if they don't have benefits, so you could, had to probably hold down two jobs for benefits. So I just, I decided not to go along those lines. I am thankful, so and the bill, brain surgery is half a million and we only paid just over one thousand dollars. Well, but Medicaid and Blue Cross, you know, oh yeah, Medicare and Blue Cross paid for that. Yeah, if I had had to be a preacher, he's going to, that's right, my glasses are fogging up. I made myself nervous. Well, what do you mean to tell his story? The boy was kicking the ball and it goes through the window and he lands on his father and his father throws it back at him or are you going to discipline him, yes, no. First one picture is probably a child, don't want the umbrella and mama said that you need an umbrella and probably they said the child, you don't need one, so he goes out in the rain and he gets wet and goes back and gets the umbrella so he can get dry. Well, it was probably the little girl had the cat and the dog chased him up the tree and dad got up on the tree and he lost his ladder and he was probably afraid to the drop, get down and the fireman had to be called to get the dad and the cat down, somewhat about that. I can't probably get the words out. Cinderella's, I don't know if his mother or stepmother or two two sisters or they're ugly and Cinderella is beautiful, so but they're into themselves and my stepmother treats the other girls nice and taking to parties and Cinderella had to scrub the floors and she was a stepmother who was harsh and so Fairy Godmother comes into view and helps her out and turns a pumpkin into the chariot and horses and anyway animals and had glass slippers and she went to the ball and met the prince and she had, she was late and the pumpkin turned out, turned back in and horses and men, so the prince tried to get the youngers, women to try on the slipper and the two ugly sisters, the feet, they tried to get, stick it in their feet to the slipper and so Cinderella had a fit to the slipper and lived happily ever, get the bread, get the peanut butter and jar and jelly jar and get the knife and spread on the peanut butter and get a spoon and dig out the jelly and spoon it on the bread and eat it, that's right.
