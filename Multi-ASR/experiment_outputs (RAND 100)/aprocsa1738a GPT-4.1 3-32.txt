Okay. Very erratic. I'm close to ten years since the stroke and I've been more or less talking for the last seven and at times this tenth year I can wake up and feel fine and pronounce things very carefully. Other times I'm off in the fall somewhere about back and forth more than others this past year or so. So anything else? It was late into December. I was alone in my small house behind my friend with my doors and I suddenly went I say at this point I'll say blank but going back is far beyond just I couldn't get a hold of myself and I was in the house, it was very cold, it was very messy, and I sat there for somewhere between two and three days. Eventually my daughter came in. So yeah, it was very long. I couldn't move. I feel very more or less blessed by my recovery because I got up and moved eventually. Months later I couldn't walk for about, I think, about four months, three or four months, but I have been doing the things I was asked to do and I read and I write and I draw and I walk a deal and I'm doing yoga at this point about twice a week, two or three times a week. Okay. You look very sprightly. Well, one on one therapy, just sit down and not exactly. It's more or less being connected to a vision of a group but occasionally for two or three months at a time one on one. So okay. Just totally at random. Okay. So many different things are important to me. I don't know really what to draw from. Every week is I experience several things that are important, really mind bogglingly important. So okay. Currently I think I'm very concerned about the national political mood in this country and I'm working, I'm concentrating on something I can do on a daily basis that takes the president out of office. And also I'm praying and talking with every people about it. So that's very current and very important at the moment. So yeah. Not too many churches lately. I'm thinking about it a great deal and maybe hoping to return to California in another maybe one to two years. So where? I'm New Meteer in Powers for right near long Redondo. Yeah. Redondo is almost my favorite beach long ago. It's here for this tide around and I'll think about it. The second place. I have to think about it. It's long ago. Okay. Wide. It used to be very wide. I haven't been there for a while. So yeah. And yeah. Yeah. But yeah, my first cousin living in on the beach in Man. Almost beach. So okay. Well, the boy is kicking the ball, is going through the window, is dropped next to a younger and older man who grabs it below and that's basically. Okay. I've been very busy. Basically the young boy has no umbrella from the mother. He says goodbye, goes out, and it starts raining. He runs back. It's all wet. The mother looks at him a bit scoldingly so he takes the umbrella and he walks to school, I guess, and for his story. Okay. Very basically the little girl is trying to reach the kitty cat in the branches. There's a letter and a tricycle next to her close to the tree as a forlorn looking man looking out as the bark dog barks up at him and the two farmers are running with another letter from the fire truck to presumably put the letter up and rescue the man and there's a bird sitting above and singing to the heavens and for story. Was trying. Close. The basics. Yeah. Okay. Simply put, Cinder was a lonely, pretty and good natured and in the servitude of an evil stepmother and two stepdaughters, step sisters. And so the whole story, right? Okay. I got to keep work but I'll try. So there's a ball and the mother and the mother and the sisters are very worked up about the whole thing and going to try on their best costume. Now, Cinderella is also worked up but she's going to, the mother is going to order to sit in the house and clean. So off the mother and sisters go and Cinder is very forlorn but all the household critters are gathered and send her off in a fancy gown. And I think this is where a good fairy appears to her and comes a mushroom, sorry, the pumpkin to a carriage and off she goes to the ball and naturally she is the first one of all and has to be at the very square has told her that she has to return at midnight. So she has a great time dancing with the prince who is totally in love with her now. But the clock strikes ten, sorry, twelve and she runs out the door and leaves one shoe in the entrance. He gets a carriage and rides home. This is the carriage is turning back into a pumpkin and her gorgeous gown turns to old rags and she returns to the day-to-day chores. But there's back and forth but the wicked stepmother and the step sisters try to dress up and present themselves to the princess emissaries and but I forget the little detail but she appears at the look at nick at time and the emissary puts the magic shoe on her and everything is hunky dory. That's about it. Okay. Again, I again and again I watch it the whole thing in my brain forever. You bet. Of course. Okay. I'll get bread. I'm sorry. Wheat bread. And put the jelly peanut butter on the one side of the bread and hopefully apricot jelly on the other side together and eat it.
