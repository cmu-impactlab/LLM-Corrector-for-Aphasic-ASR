Okay, very erratic. I'm close to ten years since the stroke and I've been more or less talking for the last seven. And at times this time of year I can wake up and feel fine and pronounce things very carefully. Other times I'm off in the fall somewhere about back and forth more than others this past year or so. It was late in December. I was alone in my small house behind my friend with my daughters. I suddenly went, I would say at this point I was so blank, but going back as far beyond this I couldn't get a hold of myself. I was in the house, it was very cold, it's very messy, and I sat there for somewhere between two and three days. Eventually my daughter came in. So yeah, it was very long. I couldn't move. I feel very more or less blessed by my recovery because I got up and moved eventually. Months later I couldn't walk for about, I think, about four months, three or four months. But I have been doing the things I was asked to do and I read and I write and I draw and I walk a deal and I'm doing yoga at this point about twice a week, two or three times a week. Okay, you look very brightly. Yeah, well, one on one therapy, just sit down and not exactly. It's more or less being connected to aphasia of a group, but occasionally for two or three months at a time one on one. So okay, just totally random. Okay, so many different things are important to me. I don't know really what to draw from. Every week is I experience several things that are important, really mind bogglingly important. I think I'm very concerned about the national political mood in this country and I'm working, I'm concentrating on something that I can do on a daily basis that takes the president out of office. And also I'm praying and talking with every people about it. That's very current and very important at the moment. Not too many church lately. I'm thinking about it a great deal. I'm maybe hoping to return to California for another maybe one to two years. I'm new, no media in Powell Springs near long. By the way, Redondo is almost my favorite beach long ago. It's dear for this time around and I'll think about it. It's second place, I have to think about it. It's long ago. Okay, wide, it used to be very wide. I hadn't been there for a while. Yeah, yeah, first cousin living in on the beach in Manhattan Beach. Okay, the boy is kicking the ball, is going through the window, is dropping it next to a young, older man who grabs the glove. That's basic. I've been very basically. The young boy has no umbrella from the mother. He says goodbye, goes out, and it starts raining. He runs back, it's all wet. The mother looks at him a bit scoldingly so he takes to the brother and walks to school I guess and read stories. Okay, very basically the little girl is trying to reach the kitty cat in the branches. There's a letter and a child next to her, closer to the tree is a forlorn looking man looking out as the dog barks up at him. The two farm are running with another letter from the fire truck to presumably put the letter up and rescue the man and it's a bird sitting above and singing to the heavens and was trying to close the basic. Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. Simply put, Cinderella was a wonderfully pretty and good natured and in the servitude of evil stepmother and two stepdaughters, step sisters, and Cinderella won the whole story, right? I've got to keep awake but I'll try. So there's the ball and the mother and the sisters are very worked up about the whole thing and going to try on the best costumes. Now Cinderella is also worked up but she is going to, the mother is going to order to sit in the house and clean. So off the mother and stepdaughters go and Cinderella is very forlorn but all the neighborhood household critters are gathered and send her off in a fancy gown. I think this was the word, a good fairy appears to her and turns the pumpkin into a carriage. Off she goes to the ball. Naturally she is the first one of all and has to be, the various couriers have told her that she has to return at midnight. She has a great time dancing with the prince who is totally in love with her now, but the clock strikes twelve and she runs out the door and leaves one shoe in the entrance and gets a carriage and rides home. The carriage is turning back into a pumpkin and her gorgeous gown turns to old rags and a return to the hospital, sorry, the day to day chores. And there's a back and forth about the wicked stepmother and the stepsisters try to dress up and present themselves to princess emissaries. I forget all the little details but she appears at the look at time and the emissary puts the magic shoe on her and everything is hunky dory. That's about it. Okay, again and again I watched the whole damn thing, it's into my brain forever. It's too bad of course. Okay, cool. I'll get bread, I am sorry, wheat bread, and put the jelly peanut butter on the one side of the bread and hopefully apricot jelly on the other side together and eat it.
