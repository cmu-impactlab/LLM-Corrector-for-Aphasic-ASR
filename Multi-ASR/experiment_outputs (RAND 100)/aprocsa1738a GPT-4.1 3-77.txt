OK, very erratic. I'm close to ten years since the stroke, and I've been more or less talking for the last seven and at times this time of year I can wake up and feel fine and pronounce things very carefully. Other times I'm off in the fall somewhere about back and forth, more than others past year or so. Anything else, as late in December I was alone in my small house behind my friend with my daughters and I suddenly went, I'll say at this point I'll say blank, but going back as far beyond this, I couldn't get a hold of myself and I was in the house, very cold, it's very messy, and I sat there from somewhere between two and three days. Eventually my daughter came in, so yeah, it was very long. I couldn't move. I feel very more or less blessed by my recovery because I got up and eventually months later I couldn't walk for about, I think about four months, three or four months, but I have been doing the things I was asked to do and I read and I write and I draw and I walk, and I'm doing yoga at this point about twice a week, two or three times a week. You look very brightly, yeah, I'm well. One on one therapy just sit down and not exactly, it's more or less being connected to a facial of and in group but occasionally for two or three months at a time, one on one, so just totally at random. OK, so many different things are important to me. I don't know really what to draw from the every week is I experience several things that are important, really mind bogglingly important. So OK, currently I think I'm very concerned about the national political mood in this country and I'm working, I'm concentrated on something I can do on a daily basis that takes the pressing offers and also I'm praying and talking with every people about it, so that's very current and very important at the moment. So not too many church lately. I've been thinking about a great deal and maybe hoping to return to California for another maybe one to two years where you know media and powers for right near long. By the way, Redonda is almost almost my favourite beach long ago. It's dear for this time and I'll think about it. The second place I have to think about it. It's long ago, it used to be very wide. I hadn't been there for a while, so yeah, yeah. First cousin living in on the beach and man. So the boy is kicking the ball, it's going through the window, it's dropping next to a young, an older man who now grows it blow. Basic and then very basically he, young boy is, has no umbrella from the mother. He says goodbye, goes out and it starts raining. He runs back and it's all wet. The mother looks a bit scoldingly, so he takes the umbrella and he walks to school I guess and story very basically. The little girl is trying to raise the kitty cat in the branches. There's a flutter and a tricycle next to her closer to the tree as a forlorn looking man looking out as the bark dog barks up at him and the two farmers are running with another letter from the frog truck to presumably put the letter and rescue the man and it's a bird sitting up and singing to heaven and this story was trying the basic, yeah, yeah, OK, OK, simply put, now. Cinderella was alarmingly pretty and good natured and in the servitude of evil stepmother and two stepdaughters, stepsisters, you know. Really want the whole story, right? OK, and I got to keep awake, but I'll try. So there's a ball and the mother and the mother and the sisters very worked out about the whole thing and are going to try on the best costumes now. Cinderella is also woke her up, but she is going to, the mother is going to order to sit in the house and clean, so off the mother steps go and Cinderella is very forlorn, but all the neighbourhood household careers are gather in, send her off in a fancy gown and I think this was the word, a good friend appears to her and comes mushroom, sorry, the pumpkin into a carriage and off she goes to the ball and naturally he is, she is the first warden of ball and has to be the various critters have told her that he has to return at midnight so he has a great time dancing with the prince who is totally in love with her now and but the clock strikes, sorry, twelve and she runs out the door and leaves one shoe and the elder enters and he gets a carriage and rides home and this is the, the carriage is turning back into a pumpkin and her gorgeous gown turns to old rags and returns to the hospital, sorry, sorry, the day to day chores and it's back and forth but the wicked stepmother and the stepsisters try to dress up and present themselves to the princess emissaries and but I forget all the little details but she appears and look at nick at time and the emissary puts the magic shoe on her and everything is hunky dory. That's about it. OK, again and again I watched the whole damn thing for like you know my brain for of course OK cool yeah I'll get bread, I'm sorry, wheat bread, and put the jelly peanut butter on the one side of the bread and hopefully apricot jelly on the other side together and eat it, yes.
