she was real mean to cinderella and made her do the work around the house she had two stepsisters who were just as mean to her one day the palace put out an invitation to every maiden in the land to come to see if the prince was interested and cinderella wanted to go she busied herself all up with the preparations and secretly she made a dress and it was time to leave and they said there was some things on her gown that you know like the ribbons and stuff like that and anyway she tore it to shreds and so the stepmother and stepsisters you know took off for the ball and cinderella cried and suddenly she saw a fairy godmother godmother and she gave no she didn't no well anyway she gave her a pretty dress to wear and she made a pumpkin into a coach and she made field mice into footmen and she said be back by twelve o'clock you know and cinderella went to the ball and she danced with the prince and everything and it struck midnight and she had to get away and anyway she got away but by the time she got back her clothes were all gone and the coach and all had disappeared but only she had one slipper a gold slipper and anyway the call went out that the prince was looking for someone to fit in the slipper and the stepmother and the stepsisters were ready for them and they came but it didn't fit them and anyway cinderella came and she tried the slipper on and you know they lived happily ever after you know okay okay well you start with bread and you take the peanut butter and you and you lift it out and you spread it and then you take the peanut and you lift it out i mean the
