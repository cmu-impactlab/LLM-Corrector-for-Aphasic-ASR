not very good that's that's my take on it i can't think i can't say what i want to and spelling is just like i had to ask oh ask it the phone where whatever her name it was to spell guard g u a r d but i couldn't spell and simple words simple words i can't think of it and but if i had look it up in dictionary or it light will go off and i won't be able to spell it but to think of it i can't even i still still struggle to text because i can't think of the right spelling not spelling spelling and and word phrase so she gets aggravated so well the the initial one i remember we always kissed before we go to bed and well she said that i didn't pucker is just you know right here and and i said well well over and over again i couldn't i couldn't say just what and i remember that the ride up to the gas station for the er i remember going in but that was the last thing i remember until i woke up in vanderbilt ambulance i just i was scared because i couldn't communicate and had a deep depression so and i had had to train all over again just to brush my teeth so it was just i guess that surgeon said that you know the cluster of vessels right here and it burst and so that i i i wanted to when released me i i wanted to drive but anyway yeah and every time i talk at least if we're conversation right here you know the the i don't know you and right here i am sweating and i didn't i didn't do that before the stroke and so just to know that my my glasses fogged up and i am starting to sweat yep but the my friend if we have could talk lengthy i i start to start to sweat too but just like if i was going to lows i mean just just to i think i was i was even i embarrassed to communicate because you know i have stumbled and can't think of the words and and so every time i do that sweat so but anyway you know well the speech therapist at tenova but that was i think it was six months so but the insurance cut me off i don't think so was it it was still a challenge even even though got to i don't know was it september i got home something like that so it's still had had to learn all over again well she had me read and say say the dumbest things over and over and over i don't know just that five you know four four words over and over again and five or i mean six talking she said it and then i said well that sentence and and i had to repeat i don't know do what i do my dad was a preacher and he went to flint michigan from florence alabama in january of sixty seven and he preached at her parents was converted and so i seeked her out but well i was in henderson tennessee going to freed hardeman college and it was a college there then it's not now it's a university but she was still in flint michigan so that had a long distance relationship so and i started out preaching but her dad was in general motors he was a grinder skill trades and he said that the shops were hiring but the shop he the shops weren't hiring as well as he he thought and we took we went up there in january seventy three and and and i got in july thirty first so but that was a good move because we had retirement and the general motors stopped that retirement in probably o seven or o eight and i retired in o three that was a good move i just didn't want to be like my dad because preachers don't have a retirement you go to work and you die and if they don't have benefits and so you could had to probably hold down two jobs for benefits so i just i decided not to go along those lines i am thankful and the bill brain surgery is half a million and we only paid just over one thousand dollars but medicaid and blue cross you know medicare and blue cross paid for that if i had had to be a preacher he's going to that's right my glasses are fogging up i make myself nervous well what do you mean i tell you story the boy just kicking the ball and it goes through the window and he lands on his father and his father throws it back at him or are you going to discipline him yes well no well first one that picture is probably the child don't want the umbrella and mama said that you need the umbrella and probably they said the child you don't need one so he goes out in the rain and he gets wet and goes back and gets the umbrella so he can get dry real good well this probably the little girl had the cat and the dog chased him up the tree and dad got up on the tree and he lost his ladder and he's probably doesn't afraid to drop get down and the fireman had to be called to get the dad and the cat down i can't probably get the words out cinderella's i don't know if his mother or stepmother or anyway two two sisters are they're ugly and cinderella's beautiful so but they are into themselves and my stepmother treats the other girls nice and taking the parties and cinderella had to scrub the floors and she was a stepmother who was harsh and so fairy godmother comes in the view and helps her out and turns a pumpkin into the chariot and horses and anyway animals and had glass slippers and she went to the ball and met the prince and she was late and the pumpkin turned back in and horses and men so the prince tried to get the younger women to try on the slipper and the two ugly sisters the feet they tried to get stick in their feet to the slipper and so cinderella had had a fit to the slipper and lived happily ever get the bread get the peanut butter and jar and jelly jar and get the knife spread on the peanut butter and get a spoon and dig out the jelly and spoon it on the bread and eat it that's right
