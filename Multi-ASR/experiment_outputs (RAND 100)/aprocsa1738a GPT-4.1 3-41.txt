Okay. Very erratic. I'm close to ten years since the stroke and I've been more or less talking for the last seven. And at times, this time of year I can wake up and feel fine and pronounce things very carefully. Other times, I'm off in the fall somewhere about back and forth more than others past year or so. Anything else? As late in December, I was alone in my small house behind my friend and my daughters. And I suddenly went, I would say, at this point I would say blank. But going back as far beyond this, I couldn't get ahold of myself. And I was in the house, it was very cold and very messy, and I sat there for somewhere between two and three days. Eventually my daughter came in. So, yeah, it was very long. I couldn't move. I feel very more or less blessed by my recovery, because I got up and moved eventually, months later. I couldn't walk for about, I think, about four months, three or four months. But I have been doing the things I was asked to do and I read and I write and I draw and I walk around and deal. I'm doing yoga at this point about twice a week, two or three times a week. Okay. You look very spritely. Yeah, well, one-on-one therapy, just sit down and not exactly. It's more or less being connected to a patient or in group, but occasionally for two or three months at a time, one-on-one. Okay. Just totally at random. Okay. There's so many different things that are important to me. I don't know really what to draw from. Every week is, I experience several things that are important, really mind-blowingly important. So, okay, currently I think I'm very concerned about the national political mood in this country. And I'm working, I'm concentrated on something that I can do on a daily basis that takes the present me out of it. And also I'm praying and talking with every people about it. So that's very current and very important at the moment. So, yeah, not too many choices lately. I've been thinking about it a great deal. I may be hoping to return to California in another maybe one to two years. Where? You know, media in Palos Verdes right near along Redondo? Yeah. I do that. By the way, Redondo is almost, almost my favorite beach. It was long ago. It's beautiful this time around and I'll think about it. Well, it's second place. I have to think about it. Yeah. It was long ago. Wide, used to be very wide. I haven't been there for a while, so yeah. Yeah. All good. Some first cousin living in, on the beach in Hermosa Beach. So, okay. Let's see. Boy is kicking the ball, it's going through the window and it's dropping next to a young, older man who grabs it and throws it. And that's basic. Been very basically, the young boy has no umbrella from the mother. He says, "Goodbye," goes out, and it starts raining. He runs back and it's all wet and the mother looks at him a bit scoldingly. So, he takes the umbrella and he walks to school, I guess. End of story. Okay. Again, very basically, the little girl is trying to reach the kitty cat in the branches. There's a letter and a cycle next to her. Closer to the tree is a forlorn-looking man looking out as the dog barks up at him and the two firemen are running with another letter from the fire truck to presumably put the letter and rescue the man. And there's a bird sitting above them singing to heavens. End of story. Was trying. Close. The basics. Yeah. Okay. That's it. I'm sorry. Okay. Simply put, now, Cinderella was a wonderfully pretty and good natured and in the servitude of evil stepmother and two stepsisters. And really want the whole story, right? Okay. I have got to keep awake, but I'll try. So, there's a ball and the mother and the sisters are very worked up about the whole thing and going to try on their best costumes. Now, Cinderella was also worked up but she is going to, the mother is going to order to sit in the house and clean. So off the mother and stepsisters go and Cinderella is very forlorn but all the neighborhood household couriers are gathered and send her off in a fancy gown. And I think this, what's the word, a good fairy appears to her and comes the mushroom, sorry, the pumpkin into a carriage and off she goes to the ball. And naturally she is the fairest one of all and has to be, the various couriers have told her that she has to return at midnight. So she has a great time dancing with the prince who is totally in love with her now. But the clock strikes twelve and she runs out the door and leaves one shoe in the hall, out of the entrance. And she gets in a carriage and rides home. This is the carriage turning back into a pumpkin and her gorgeous gown turns to old rags and she returns to the day-to-day chores. And there's a back and forth about the wicked stepmother and they start searches, try to dress up and present themselves to the princess emissaries. But I forget all the little details but she appears at the nick of time and the emissary puts the magic shoe on her and everything is hunky-dory. That's about it. Okay. Again, as I again and again, I watched it, the whole damn thing. It's in my brain forever. It's too bad. Yeah. Of course. Okay. Oh, no. Cool. Yeah. All right. I'll get bread. I'm sorry, wheat bread. And put the jelly, peanut butter on one side of the bread and hopefully apricot jelly on the other side together and eat it. Yes.
