things that I had in my life now I look at it you that old and then I said I'm seventy one I guess you are that old one a boy he is thirty yeah yeah yeah okay the little boy is playing soccer and he's playing happy and then he kicked the ball and the neighbor's window broke because he kicked it through the window and then the man was sitting in the living room and the ball came through and he was shocked and the lamp fell over and stuff and then he got up and he said it's a soccer ball and he looked out the window to see who he kicked it oh yeah okay this little boy or little girl it looked like a girl but he's going to school and his mama said take this umbrella because it looks like rain and he said I don't want to take that I might lose it it's not raining and as he goes to school it started to rain and it rained and then he came back and he looked he was all wet and his mother said didn't I tell you to take the umbrella and so he got the umbrella and he started back to school okay the girl got a cat that up the cat is up in the tree so he said please get my cat and she was riding on her tricycle and she tried to get the cat down but he wouldn't go and so he he he asked the man to get it down with the ladder but he didn't make it he's still up in the tree and the cat's up in the tree and so they called the fire department and the dog is barking at the man but then the fire department came and they got the cat out of the tree yeah there's a lot I didn't mention the bird that's just sitting there looking that's all he was going to do okay it's a story about cinderella he had her his daddy was a widow because his wife died and she was very neat and pretty when she was a little girl and then his mother his daddy said I'm going to marry this woman she was a very treacherous woman and she wanted to marry him so they married and she had two little girls very very ugly girls and so then the daddy died and all she said she was going to run the house and she didn't want cinderella to have pretty clothes she wanted her to have rags and then she said I don't have a maid to run this house so you will be the maid and you will be my maid and the girls too and then by this time they had grown up and so she fixed the wood the fire and did the housework and cooked the breakfast and stuff for them anything they wanted she had to do it and so she lived up in the attic and when she had the animals to talk to her the horse and the rats and the cat and things that's all she had to talk to and then a telegram came because the king wants his son to marry so he had a ball and so he tried to see who he would want to marry but so the two girls and the mother got some fancy clothes and everything to go to the ball because she wanted one of them to marry the prince so the mother had left a dress for and she said I will I will use this my mother's dress and I will fix it up and then when the mother and two girls had to get ready and dressed up and go to the ball and then cinderella came down I want to go too and they were very very ugly and said oh you wanted to go you can't go and then she the dress she had they pitted they smashed it and so after they had made the dress messy and torn and they went to the ball and then the mother put cinderella upstairs I think and so she couldn't go out and then the fairy godmother came and cinderella looked and she told them they wouldn't let me go to the ball and so she said just a minute I'll see about this and so she got her a dress a pretty dress and made the pumpkin and the rats and the cats now made them the footstools and the driver and things and so you go into the ball but you must get back by twelve o'clock all this I fixed for you will be gone and so they all went to the ball and cinderella came and the old battleaxe was looking and the girls were too they said who is that girl going at the ball and looking at the prince looking at her and so the prince danced with her all the night and so she wanted to know he wanted to know what her name is and where is she but she didn't tell and then she had some pretty shoes they were glass shoes and the clock was chiming twelve o'clock so that she got to let go because she said the fairy godmother said if you don't get out there by twelve you'll have all that stuff it will go back so she was going and running and running and one of the shoes were left on the steps she was running and running she got to get out of there and the pumpkin and the rats and all the horse they all went back to what they were and so then the old mother put her up in the they came around her house and said I wanted you to look at this shoe to see if you can wear it and the other one she said I will fit it but it didn't fit either and then the other shoe and the mother's other shoe and they found it was her and so they had a big wedding and they lived happy ever after you know I was a teacher and I would tell all kinds of stories yeah I was
