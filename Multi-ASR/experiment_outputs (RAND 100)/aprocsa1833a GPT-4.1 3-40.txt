Not very good. That's my take on it. I can't think, I can't say what I want to. Spelling is just like I had to ask the phone or whatever her name it was to spell guard G U A R D, but I couldn't spell it and simple words, simple words are I can't think of it. But if I had look it up in dictionary or light will go off and I won't be able to spell it. But to think of it, I still struggle to text because I can't think of the right spelling, not spelling, spelling and word phrase. She gets aggravated. So yeah, well, the initial one I remember, we always kiss before we go to bed and she said that I didn't pucker, just, you know, right here. And I said, well, well, over and over again, I couldn't, I couldn't say just what. And I remember that the ride up to the gas station for the ER, I remember going in, but that was the last thing I remember until I woke up in Vanderbilt ambulance. I was scared because I couldn't communicate and I had a deep depression, so I had to train all over again just to brush my teeth. It was just, I guess, the surgeon said that the cluster of vessels right here, and it burst and so that I wanted to, when released me, I wanted to drive. But anyway, yeah, and every time I talk at least if we're conversation right here and you know, the, I don't know you and right here I am sweating and I didn't do that before the stroke and so just to know that my glasses fogged up and I am starting to sweat. But the, my friend, if we have to talk lengthy, I started to sweat too, but just like if I was going to Lowe's, I mean, just to, I think I was, I was even embarrassed to communicate because you know, I stumble and can't think of the words. And so every time I do that, sweat, so but anyway, you know, the speech therapist at Tenova, but that was, I think it was six months, so but insurance cut me off. I don't think so. It was still a challenge even though, got, I don't know, was it September I got home, something like that, so it still had to learn all over again. Well, she had me read and say the dumbest things over and over and over. I don't know, just four words over and over again, then five, four, I mean six, talking. She said it and then I said, well, that sentence and I had to repeat. I don't know, do that. I do, my dad was a preacher and he went to Flint, Michigan from Florence, Alabama in January of sixty-seven and he preached at her parents, was converted and so I seeked her out. Well, I was in Henderson, Tennessee, going to Freed-Hardeman College and it was a college there then, it's not now, it's a university, but she was still in Flint, Michigan, so that had a long distance relationship. I started out preaching, but her dad was in General Motors and he was a grinder of skill trades and he said that the shops were hiring, but the shops weren't hiring as well as he thought and we went up there in January of seventy-three and I got out in July thirty-first. So, but that was a good move because we had retirement and the General Motors stopped that retirement in probably o seven or o eight and I retired in o three. That was a good move. I just didn't want to be like my dad because preachers don't, you don't have a retirement, you go to work or you die. And if they don't have benefits, so you could, I had to probably hold down two jobs for benefits. So I just, I decided not to go along those lines. I am thankful so. And the bill, brain surgery, was half a million and we only paid just over one thousand dollars. Well, but Medicaid and Blue Cross, you know, Medicare and Blue Cross paid for that. If I had to be a preacher, he's going, that's right. My glasses are fogging out. I'm making myself nervous. Well, what do you mean to tell your story? The boy is kicking the ball and it goes through the window and he lands on his father and his father throws it back at him or are you going to discipline him? Yes, no. First one pictures probably a child don't want the umbrella and Mama said that you need the umbrella and probably they said the child you don't need one, so he goes out in the rain and he gets wet and goes back and gets the umbrella so he could get dry. Well, there's probably a little girl and the cat and the dog chased him up the tree and Dad got up on the tree and he lost his ladder and he's probably afraid to drop, get down and the fireman had to be called to get the dad and the cat down. I can't probably get the words out. Cinderella's, I don't know if it was mother or stepmother or two sisters, they're ugly and Cinderella's beautiful, so but they are into themselves and my stepmother treats the other girls nice and taking parties and Cinderella had to scrub the floors and she was a stepmother, was harsh and so very good mother comes in the view and helps her out and turns a pumpkin into the chariot and horses and anyway animals and had glass slippers and she went to the ball and met the prince and she was late and the pumpkin turned back in and horses and men, so the prince tried to get the younger women to try on the slipper and the two ugly sisters, the feet, they tried to get stick in their feet to the slipper and so Cinderella had a fit to the slipper and lived that happy to ever get the bread, get the peanut butter and jar and jelly jar and get the knife and spread on the peanut butter and get a spoon and dig out the jelly and spoon it on the bread and eat it, that's right.
