Okay very erratic I'm close to ten years since a stroke and I've been more or less talking for the last seven and at times this tenth year I can wake up and feel fine and pronounce things very carefully other times I'm often in the fall somewhere about back and forth more than others this past year or so yeah it was late in December I was alone in my small house behind my friend with my daughters I suddenly went I would say at this point I was so blank but going back as far beyond this I couldn't get a hold of myself I was in the house it was very cold it's very messy and I sat there from somewhere between two and three days so eventually my daughter came in so yeah it was very long I couldn't move I feel very more or less blessed by my recovery because I got up and moved eventually months later I couldn't walk for about I think about four months three or four months but I have been doing the things I was asked to do and I read and I write and I draw and I walk a deal I'm doing yoga at this point about twice a week two or three times a week okay you looked very spritely yeah well one on one therapy just sit down and not exactly it's more or less being connected to aphasia of a group but occasionally for two or three months at a time one on one so okay just totally at random okay so many different things are important to me I don't know really what to draw from every week is I experience several things that are important really mind bogglingly important I think I'm very concerned about the national political mood in this country and I'm working I'm concentrating on something that I can do on a daily basis that takes the president out of office and also I'm praying and talking with every people about it that's very current and very important at the moment yeah not too many church lately I'm thinking about it a great deal I'm maybe hoping to return to California for another maybe one to two years I'm new media in Palos Verdes near along Redondo by the way Redondo is almost almost my favorite beach long ago it's beautiful this time around and I'll think about it it's second place I have to think about it it's long ago okay wide it used to be very wide I haven't been there for a while yeah yeah first cousin living in on the beach in Hermosa Beach okay the boy is kicking the ball is going through the window is dropping next to a young an older man who grabs it and throws it that's basic okay very basically the young boy has no umbrella from the mother he says goodbye goes out and it starts raining he runs back and it's all wet the mother looks at him a bit scoldingly so he takes the umbrella and walks to school I guess end of story okay again very basically the little girl is trying to reach the kitty cat in the branches there's a letter and a tricycle next to her closer to the tree is a forlorn looking man looking out as the dog barks up at him the two firemen are running with another letter from the fire truck to presumably put the letter up and rescue the man and there's a bird sitting above and singing to the heavens end of story was trying close yeah the basics yeah yeah okay okay simply put Cinderella was a wonderfully pretty and good natured and in the servitude of an evil stepmother and two stepdaughters stepsisters and Cinderella want the whole story right I've got to keep awake but I'll try so there's the ball and the mother and the sisters are very worked up about the whole thing and going to try on their best costumes now Cinderella also woke up but she is going to the mother is going to order to sit in the house and clean so off the mother and stepsisters go and Cinderella is very forlorn but all the neighborhood household critters are gathered and send her off in a fancy gown I think this is where a good fairy appears to her and comes the mushroom sorry the pumpkin into a carriage off she goes to the ball naturally she is the fairest one of all and has to be the various couriers have told her that she has to return at midnight she has a great time dancing with the prince who is totally in love with her now and but the clock strikes twelve and she runs out the door and leaves one shoe in the entrance and gets in a carriage and rides home the carriage is turning back into a pumpkin and her gorgeous gown turns to old rags and she returns to the house sorry the day to day chores and there's a back and forth about the wicked stepmother and the stepsisters try to dress up and present themselves to the princess emissaries and I forget all the little details but she appears at the late time and the emissary puts the magic shoe on her and everything is hunky dory that's about it okay again as I again and again I watched the whole thing it's in my brain forever it's too bad of course okay cool I'll get bread I am sorry wheat bread and put the jelly peanut butter on one side of the bread and hopefully apricot jelly on the other side together and eat it
