Okay very erratic I'm close to ten years since the stroke and I've been more or less talking for the last seven and at times this time of year I can wake up and feel fine and pronounce things very carefully other times I'm off in the fall somewhere about back and forth more than others past year or so anything else yeah as late in December I was alone in my small house behind my friend with my daughters and I suddenly went I would say at this point I'll say blank but going back as far beyond this I couldn't get a hold of myself and I was in the house very cold it's very messy and I sat there for somewhere between two and three days eventually my daughter came in so yeah it was very long I couldn't move I feel very more or less blessed by my recovery because I got up and moved eventually months later I couldn't walk for about I think about four months three or four months but I have been doing the things I was asked to do and I read and I write and I draw and I walk deal and I'm doing yoga at this point about twice a week two or three times a week you look very sprightly yeah well one-on-one therapy just sit down and not exactly it's more or less being connected to a phase of a group but occasionally for two or three months at a time one-on-one so just totally random okay so many different things are important to me I don't know really what to draw from every week is I experience several things that are important really mind boggling and important so okay currently I think I'm very concerned about the national political mood in this country and I'm working I'm concentrated on something I can do on a daily basis that takes the present out of us and also I'm praying and talking with every people about it so that's very current and very important at the moment so yeah not too many churches lately I've been thinking about a great deal I don't know maybe hoping to rule two hundred California if another maybe one to two years so where I'm you know media and power sprays right near long yeah by the wood Regina is almost almost my favorite beach long ago I sit there for this time around room and I'll think about it it's second place I have to think about it as long as long ago wide used to be very wide I hadn't been for a while so yeah yeah it's first cousin living in on the beach and man on most of the beach so okay the boy is kicking the ball is going through the window has dropped it next to a young older man who now grassy blown as basic I've been very basically the young boy has no umbrella from the mother he says goodbye goes out and it starts raining he runs back and it's all wet the mother looks at him a bit scoldingly so he takes the bread and walks to school I guess and restore okay and again very basically the little girl is trying to reach the kitty cat in the branches there's a ladder and a child next to her closer to the tree as a forlorn looking man looking out as the bark dog barks up at him and the two farm running with another letter from the fire truck to presumably put the letter and rescue the man and it's a bird sitting up and singing to the heavens and restore was trying close the basic yeah yeah okay okay okay simply put now Cinderella was really pretty and good natured and in the servitude of evil stepmother and two stepsisters and really want the whole story right okay I've got to keep awake but I'll try so there's a ball and the mother and the mother and the sisters are very worked up about the whole thing and going to try on the best costumes now Cinderella was also worked up but she is going to the mother is going to order to sit in the house and clean so off the mother and stepsisters go and Cinderella is very forlorn but all the neighborhood household careers are gathered and send her off in a fancy gown and I think this was the word a good fairy appears to her and comes a mushroom sorry the pumpkin into a carriage and off she goes to the ball and naturally she is the first warden of all and has to be the various couriers have told her that she has to return at midnight so has a great time dancing with the Prince who is totally in hope of her now but the clock strikes ten I'm sorry twelve and she runs out the door and leaves one shoe in the hall of the entrance and in guessing carriage and rides home this is the carriage is turning back into a pumpkin and her gorgeous gown turns to old rags and returns to the to the hospital sorry the day-to-day chores and there's a back and forth but the wicked stepmother and the stepsisters try to dress up and present themselves to the Princess emissaries but I forget all the little details but she appears and look at nick at time and the emissary puts the magic shoe on her and everything is hunky dory that's about it okay again as I again and again I watched the whole damn thing for like you know my brain prayer for too bad of course okay cool yeah I'll get bread I'm sorry wheat bread and put the jelly peanut butter on the one side of the bread and hopefully apricot jelly on the other side together and eat it yes
