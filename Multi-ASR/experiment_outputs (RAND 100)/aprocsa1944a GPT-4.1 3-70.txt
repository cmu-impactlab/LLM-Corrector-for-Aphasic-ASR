daddy was a widow because his wife died and she was very neat and pretty when she was a little girl and then his mother his daddy said i'm going to marry this woman she was a very treacherous woman and she wanted to marry him so they married and she had two little girls very very very ugly girls and so then the daddy died and all she said she was going to run the house and she didn't want cinderella to have pretty clothes she wanted her to have rags and then she said i don't have a maid to run this house so you will be the maid and you will be my maid and the girls too and then by this time they had grown up and so she fixed the wood the fire and did the housework and cooked the breakfast and stuff for them anything they wanted she had to do it and so she lived up in the attic and when she had the animals to talk to her the horse and the rats and the cat and things that's all she had to talk to and then a telegram came because the king wants his son to marry so he had a ball and so he took and see who will you want to marry but so the two girls and the mother got some fancy clothes and everything to go to the ball because she wanted one of them to marry the prince so the mother had left a dress for and see i will i will use this this my mother's dress and i will fix it up and then when the mother and two girls had to get ready and dressed up and go to the ball and then cinderella came down and said i want to go too and they were very very ugly and i said oh you want to go you can't go and out she the dress she had they pitted she pitted out they smashed it and so after they had made the dress messy and torn and they went to the ball and then the mother put cinderella upstairs i think and so she couldn't go out and then the fairy godmother came and cinderella looked and she told they wouldn't let me go to the ball and so she said just a minute i'll see about this and so she got her a dress a pretty dress and made the pumpkin and the rats and the cats now made them the foot stalls and the driver and things and so you go into the ball but you must get back by twelve o'clock all this i fixed for you will be gone and so they all went to the ball and cinderella came and the old old old man the old man the old battleaxe was looking and the girls were too they said where's that girl going at the ball and looking at the prince is looking at her

wear it and the other one so she said i will fit it but it didn't fit either and then the other shoe and the mother's other shoe and they found it was her and so they had a big wedding and they lived happy ever after yeah the best retelling of cinderella i think that's weird about the you know i was a teacher and i would tell all kind of stories yeah i was going to ask if you ever told your students yeah kids yeah kids in there yeah yeah i'm sure they loved it when you did oh yeah yeah thank you you even reminded me of some details that i forgot alright yeah it was great okay i have one more talking thing for you okay and then we're going to do the language test and then just a couple more things okay okay so this is going to be a little bit different okay i want you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich oh okay alright you get the cabinet and you get some bread two pieces of bread out of the i say sack but that's not the what the bread stays in and so the peanut butter and the two pieces of bread and okay you get a piece of bread and you oh you need a knife and then you put and then you put the bread and you put another the other piece on the peanut butter and then you eat it yeah okay that's the way i think i say it
