not very good. that's that's my take on it. I can't think I can't say what I want to. and spelling is just like I had to ask at the phone, whatever her name was, to spell guard, g u a r d. but I couldn't spell and simple words, simple words are I can't think of it. but if I had to look up a dictionary or it light would go off and I would be able to spell it. but to think of it I can't. even I still still struggled to text because I can't think of the right spelling, not spelling and spelling and word phrase so she gets aggravated. well, the initial one, I remember we always kissed before we go to bed and well, she said that I didn't pucker. you know, right here. and I said, well, well, over and over again. I couldn't I couldn't say just what. and I remember the ride up to the gas station for the er. I remember going in, but that was the last thing I remember until I woke up in vanderbilt ambulance. I just I was scared because I couldn't communicate and I had a deep depression. so and I had had to train all over again just to brush my teeth. so it was just I guess that the surgeon said that you know, the cluster of vessels right here and it burst and so I I wanted to when released me I wanted to drive. but anyway. yeah, and every time I talk at least if we could conversation right here, you know, the I don't know you and right here, I am sweating and I didn't I didn't do that before the stroke and so just to know that my glasses fogged up and I am starting to sweat. yep. but my friend, if we have to talk lengthy, I started to sweat too. but just like if I was going to lowe's, I mean, just just to I think I was embarrassed, even I'm embarrassed to communicate because you know, I stumble and can't think of the words and so every time I do that, sweat. so, but anyway. well, the speech therapist at tenova but that was I think it was six months, so but the insurance cut me off. I don't think so was that? well, it was still a challenge, even though I got, I don't know, was it september, I got home, something like that. so it's still had had to learn all over again. I don't work. yeah. well, she had had me read and say say the dumbest things over and over and over. was I don't know, just five, you know, four four words over and over again. then five, four, I mean, six, talking. she said it and then I said. well, that sentence and I had to repeat. I don't know, do what? I had to my dad was a preacher and he went to flint, michigan from florence, alabama in january of sixty seven. and he preached at her parents was converted and so I seeked her out. but anyway. well, I was in henderson, tennessee going to freed hardeman college and that was a college there then. it's not now, it's a university. but she was still in flint, michigan. so that had a long distance relationship. so I started out preaching but her dad was in general motors and he was a grinder, skilled trades and he said that the shops were hiring but the shop he the shops weren't hiring as what he thought and we went up there in january of seventy three and I got out in july thirty first. so but that was a good move because we had retirement and the general motors stopped that retirement in probably o seven or o eight and I retired in o three. so it was a good move. I just didn't want to be like my dad because preachers don't have a retirement. you go to work and you die. and if they don't have benefits and so you could had had to probably hold down two jobs for benefits. so I just I decided not to go along those lines. I am thankful. and the bill for the surgery was half a million and we only paid just over one thousand dollars. but medicare and blue cross, you know. yeah. medicare and blue cross paid for that. yeah. if I had had to be a preacher, he's going that's right. my glasses are fogging up. I'm making myself nervous. well, what do you mean tell you a story? the boy's kicking the ball and it goes through the window and he lands on his father and his father throws it back at him. or are you going to discipline him? yes. well, no. first one picture is probably the child don't want the umbrella and mama said that you need an umbrella and probably they said the child you don't need one. so he goes out in the rain and he gets wet and goes back and gets the umbrella so he can get dry. really good. well, this probably the little girl had the cat and the dog chased him up the tree and dad got up on the tree and he lost his ladder and he's probably afraid to the drop get down and the fireman had to be called to get the dad and the cat down. yeah, somewhat. yeah, I don't know about that. I can't probably get the words out. cinderella's I don't know if it was mother or stepmother or anyway two sisters are they're ugly and cinderella's beautiful. so but they're into themselves and a stepmother treats the other girls nice and taking to parties and cinderella had to scrub the floors and she was a stepmother who was harsh and so fairy godmother comes into view and helps her out and turns a pumpkin into the chariot and horses and anyway animals and had glass slippers and she went to the ball and met the prince and she was late and the pumpkin turned back in and the horses and the men. so the prince tried to get the younger women to try on the slipper and the two ugly sisters, the feet, they tried to get stick it in their feet to the slipper and so cinderella had a fit to the slipper and lived happily ever after. get the bread, get the peanut butter and jar and jelly jar and get the knife and spread on the peanut butter and get a spoon and dig out the jelly and spoon it on the bread and eat it.
