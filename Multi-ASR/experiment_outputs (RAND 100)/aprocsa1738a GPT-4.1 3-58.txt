okay very erratic i'm close to ten years since the stroke and i've been more or less talking for the last seven and at times this time of year i can wake up and feel fine and pronounce things very carefully other times often in the fall somewhere about back and forth more than others past year or so it was late in december i was alone in my small house behind my friend with my daughters and i suddenly went i would say at this point i was so blank but going back as far beyond this i couldn't get a hold of myself and i was in the house it was very cold it's very messy and i sat there from somewhere between two and three days eventually my daughter came in so yeah it was very long i couldn't move i feel very more or less blessed by my recovery because i got up and eventually months later i couldn't walk for about i think about four months three or four months but i have been doing the things i was asked to do and i read and i write and i draw and i walk and i'm doing yoga at this point about twice a week two or three times a week you look very brightly yeah well one on one therapy just sit down and not exactly it's more or less being connected to aphasia and group but occasionally for two or three months at a time one on one so just totally at random okay so many different things are important to me i don't know really what to draw from the every week is i experience several things that are important really mind bogglingly important currently i think i'm very concerned about the national political mood in this country and i'm working i'm concentrating on something i can do on a daily basis that takes the pressing off and also i'm praying and talking with every people about it so that's very current and very important at the moment not too many church lately i've been thinking about a great deal and maybe hoping to return to california for another maybe one to two years where media in powers for right near long by the way redonda is almost almost my favorite beach long ago it's dear for this time and i'll think about it the second place i have to think about it it's long ago it used to be very wide i hadn't been there for a while so yeah yeah first cousin living in on the beach and man the boy is catching the ball it's going through the window it's dropping next to a young an older man who now blows it basic and then very basically the young boy has no umbrella from the mother he says goodbye goes out and it starts raining he runs back and it's all wet the mother looks a bit scoldingly so he takes the brother and he walks to school i guess and story very basically the little girl is trying to reach the kitty cat in the branches there's a letter and a tricycle next to her closer to the tree as a forlorn looking man looking out as the dog barks up at him and the two farm are running with another letter from the frog truck to prison they put the letter and rescued the man and it's a bird sitting above and singing to heaven and this story was trying the basic yeah yeah okay okay simply put cinderella was alarmingly pretty and good natured and in the servitude of evil stepmother and two stepdaughters stepsisters you know really want the whole story right okay i got to keep awake but i'll try so there's a ball and the mother and the sisters are very worked out about the whole thing and going to try on the best costumes now cinderella also woke her up but she is going to the the mother is going to order to sit in the house and clean so off the mother and stepdaughters go and cinderella is very forlorn but all the neighborhood household careers are gathered and send her off in a fancy gown and i think this was the word a good fairy appears to her and comes the pumpkin into a carriage and off she goes to the ball and naturally she is the first warden of the ball and has to be the various couriers have told her that she has to return at midnight so she has a great time dancing with the prince who is totally in love with her now but the star clock strikes twelve i'm sorry and she runs out the door and leaves one shoe and enters and gets a carriage and rides home and the carriage is turning back into a pumpkin and her gorgeous gown turns to old rags and returns to the hospital sorry sorry the day to day chores and it's back and forth but the wicked stepmother and the stepsisters try to dress up and present themselves to the princess emissaries but i forget all the little details but she appears at the nick of time and the emissary puts the magic shoe on her and everything is hunky dory that's about it okay again as i again and again i watched the whole damn thing for like you know my brain for of course okay cool i'll get bread i'm sorry wheat bread and put the jelly peanut butter on the one side of the bread and hopefully apricot jelly on the other side together and eat it yes
