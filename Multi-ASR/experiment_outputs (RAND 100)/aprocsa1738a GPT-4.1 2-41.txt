Okay, very erratic. I'm close to ten years since the stroke and I've been more or less talking for the last seven and at times this time of year I can wake up and feel fine and pronounce things very carefully. Over the times I'm often in fall, about back and forth, more than others this past year or so. It was late in December, I was alone in my small house behind my friend with my daughters and I suddenly—I'll say at this point I'll say blank—but going back as far beyond this, I couldn't get a hold of myself and I was in the house. The house is very cold, it's very messy, and I sat there from somewhere between two and three days. Eventually my daughter came in, so yeah, it was very long. I couldn't move. I feel very more or less blessed by my recovery because I got up and eventually months later I couldn't walk for about, I think, about four months, three or four months, but I have been doing the things I was asked to do and I read and I write and I draw and I walk a deal and I'm doing yoga at this point about twice a week, two or three times a week. Okay. You look very brightly, yeah, well, one on one therapy, just sit down and not exactly, it's more or less being connected to a facial of and in group but occasionally for two or three months at a time, one on one, so just totally at random. Okay, it's so many different things are important to me. I don't know really what to draw from. Every week is, I experience several things that are important, really mind bogglingly important. So okay, currently I think I'm very concerned about the national political mood in this country and I'm working, concentrated on something I can do on a daily basis that takes the pressing offers and also I'm praying and talking with every people about it, so that's very current and very important at the moment. Not too many church lately. I've been thinking about a great deal and maybe hoping to return to California for another maybe one to two years. Where, you know, media in powers for right near long, Redondo, yeah, yeah. Redondo is almost, almost my favourite beach long ago. It's dear for this time and I'll think about it. The second place, I have to think about it. It's long ago, it used to be very wide. I hadn't been there for a while, so yeah, yeah. First cousin living in on the beach and man, almost beach. So the boy is kicking the ball, it's going through the window, it's dropping next to a young, an older man who now grabs it below. Basically, the young boy has no umbrella from the mother. He says goodbye, goes out and it starts raining. He runs back and it's all wet. The mother looks a bit scoldingly, so he takes the brother and he walks to school, I guess, and story very basically. The little girl is trying to raise the kitty cat in the branches. There's water and a tricycle next to her close to the tree as a forlorn looking man looking out as the bark dog barks up at him and the two farmer are running with another letter from the fire truck to presumably put the letter and rescue the man and there's a bird sitting above and singing to heaven and this story was trying the basic, yeah, yeah, okay, okay, simply put, now. Cinder was alarmingly pretty and good natured and in the servitude of an evil stepmother and two stepdaughters, stepsisters, you know. Really want the whole story, right? Okay, and I got to keep awake, but I'll try. So there's a ball and the mother and the mother and the sister are very worked out about the whole thing and going to try on the best costumes now. Cinderella has also woke her up, but she is going to—the mother is going to order to sit in the house and clean, so off the mother and sisters go and Cinder is very forlorn, but all the household critters are gather in, send her off in a fancy gown and I think this is where a good fairy appears to her and comes mushroom, sorry, the pumpkin into a carriage and off she goes to the ball and naturally she is the first warden of ball and has to be—the various courts have told her that she has to return at midnight. So she has a great time dancing with the prince who is totally in love with her now and but the star cock strikes twelve, I'm sorry, and she runs out the door and leaves one shoe and the entrance and he gets a carriage and rides home and this is the carriage turning back into a pumpkin and her gorgeous gown turns to old rags and returns to the hospital—sorry, the day to day chores and it's back and forth but the wicked stepmother and the stepsisters try to dress up and present themselves to the princess emissaries and but I forget all the little details, but she appears and look at Nick at time and the emissary puts the magic shoe on her and everything is hunky dory. That's about it. Okay, again and again I watch it, the whole thing, for like, you know, my brain for, of course, okay, cool, yeah, I'll get bread, I'm sorry, wheat bread, and put the jelly peanut butter on the one side of the bread and hopefully apricot jelly on the other side together and eat it, yes.
