not pretty good. that's my take on it. I can't think I can't say what I want to. Yeah, and spelling is just like I had to S.O. I should ask it the phone where we're whatever her name was to spell guard, g u a r d. But I couldn't spell and simple words, simple words are I can't think of it. and but I if I had look up a dictionary or it light would go off and I would be able to spell it. But but to think of it I can't. Even I still struggled to text because I can't think of the right spelling, not spelling it spelling and word phrase so, she would gets aggravated. Oh yeah. Well, the the initial one, I remember we always kissed before we go to bed and well, she said that I didn't pucker. He just, you know, right here. And and I said, well, well, over and over again. I could I couldn't I couldn't say. Just and and I remember the ride up to the gas station for the ER. and I remember going in, but that was the last thing I remember until I woke up in Vanderbilt, ambulance. I just I was scared because I couldn't communicate and I just had a deep depression. So and I had had to train all over again just to brush my teeth. So it was just I guess that the surgeon said that you know, the cluster of vessels right here and it burst and so I I wanted to when released me, I I wanted to drive. But anyway. Yeah, and every time I talk least if we could conversation right here, any you know, the I don't know you and right here, I am sweating and I didn't I didn't do that before the stroke and I'm starting to sweat. Yep. my but the my friend if if we have to talk lengthy, I start to sweat too. But just like if I was going to Lowe's, I mean I mean, just to I think I I'm embar I was I was even I'm embarrassed to communicate because, you know, I stumble and can't think of the words and so every time I do that, sweat yeah. So, but anyway. Yeah. Well, the speech therapist at Nova but that was I think it was six months, so but the insurance cut me off. I don't think so was that? Well, it was still a challenge, even though got well, I don't know, was it September, I got home, something like that. So, it's still had had to learn all over again. I don't work. Yeah. Well, she had had me read and the say the dumbest things over and over. Was I don't know, just the five, you know, four four words over and over again. N five, four, I mean, six, talking. She said it and then I say. Well, the that sentence and I had to repeat. I don't know, do what? I had to my my dad was a preacher and she not she he went to Flint Michigan from Florence, Alabama. And in January of sixty seven. And we're she he preached at her parents was converted and so I seeked her out. but anyway. Well, I was in Henderson, Tennessee going to Freed Hardeman College and that was a college there then. It's not now, it's a university. but the she was still in Flint, Michigan. So that had a long distance relationship. So I started out preaching and but but her dad was a in General Motors and he was a grinder, a skilled trades and he said that the shops were hiring. But the shop he the shops weren't hiring as what he he thought and we took we went up there in January of seventy three and and I got out in July thirty first. So but that was a good move because we had retirement and the General Motors stopped that retirement in probably o seven or o eight and I retired in o three. So it was a good move. I just didn't want to be like my dad because preachers all don't you have you don't have a retirement. You go to work and you die. And if the they don't have a benefits and so you could had had to probably hold down two jobs for benefits. So I just I decided not to go all on that those lines. I am thankful. So and the bill for the surgery was half a million and the we we only paid just over one thousand dollars. Well, but Medicare and Blue Cross, you know. Yeah. Medicare and Blue Cross paid for that. Yeah. If I had had it be a preacher is going that's right. My my glasses are fogging up. I'm making making myself nervous. Well, what what do you mean tell you a story? the boy's kicking the ball and it goes through the window and he lands on his father and his father throws it back at him. Or or he going to discipline him. Yes. Well, no. Well, first one picture is probably the child don't want the umbrella and mom said that you need to umbrella and probably they said the child you don't need one. So he goes out in the rain and he he gets wet and goes back and gets the umbrella so he can get dry. Really good. Well, this probably the little girl had a the cat and the dog chased him up the tree and dad got up on the tree and he lost his ladder and he's probably doesn't need afraid to the drop get down and farmer had be called to get the dad and the cat down. Yeah, somewhat. Yeah, I don't know about that. I can't I can't probably get the words out. Cinderella's I don't know if it was mother or stepmother are anyway two two sisters are they're ugly and and Cinderella's beautiful. So but they're into themselves and so a stepmother treats the other girls nice and take them to parties and Cinderella had a scrub the floors and and she was stepmother was harsh and so very God mother comes into view and helps her out and turns a pumpkin into the chariot and horses and anyway animals and have glass slippers and she went to the ball and met the prince and she was late and the pumpkin turned out turned back in and the horses and the men. So so the prince tried to get the younger women to try on the slipper and the two ugly sisters, the feet they they tried to get stick it in their feet to the slipper and so Cinderella had fit to the slipper and lived at happily ever after. Get the bread, get the the peanut butter and jar and jelly jelly jar and get the knife and spread on the peanut butter and get a spoon and dig out the jelly and spoon it on the bread and eat it.
