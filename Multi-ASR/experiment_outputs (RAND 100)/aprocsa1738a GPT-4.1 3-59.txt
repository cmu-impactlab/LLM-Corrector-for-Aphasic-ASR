okay very erratic i'm close to ten years since a stroke and i've been more or less talking for the last seven and at times this tenth year i can wake up and feel fine and pronounce things very carefully over the times i'm off in the fall somewhere about back and forth more than others past year or so anything else yeah as late in december i was alone in my small house behind my friend with my daughter and i suddenly went i would say at this point i was so blank but going back is far beyond this i couldn't get a hold of myself and i was in the house it was very cold it's very messy and i sat there from somewhere between two and three days eventually my daughter came in so yeah it was very long i couldn't move i feel very more or less blessed by my recovery because i got up and eventually months later i couldn't walk for about i think about four months three or four months but i have been doing the things i was asked to do and i read and write and i draw and i walk and i'm doing yoga at this point about twice a week two or three times a week you look very brightly yeah well one on one therapy just sit down and not exactly it's more or less being connected to a group but occasionally for two or three months at a time one on one so just totally at random okay so many different things are important to me i don't know really what to draw from every week i experience several things that are important really mind boggling important so okay currently i think i'm very concerned about the national political mood in this country and i'm working i'm concentrated on something i can do on a daily basis that takes the president out of office and also i'm praying and talking with every people about it so that's very current and very important at the moment so yeah not too many churches lately i'm thinking about it a great deal and maybe hoping to return to california if another maybe one to two years so where i'm new media and power sports right near long redondo yeah redondo is almost almost my favorite beach long ago it's there for this time around i'll think about it it's second place i have to think about it it's long ago it used to be very wide i hadn't been for a while yeah yeah my first cousin living in on the beach in hermosa beach so okay the boy is kicking the ball it's going into the window it's dropped me next to a young older man who grabs it below that's basic okay i've been very busy basically the young boy has no umbrella from the mother he says goodbye goes out and it starts raining he runs back it's all wet the mother looks at him a bit scoldingly so he takes the umbrella and he walks to school i guess umbrella story okay okay very basically the little girl is trying to reach the kitty cat in the branches there's a flutter and a tricycle next to her closer to the tree as a forlorn looking man looking out as the bark dog barks up at him and the two farmers are running with another letter from the fire truck to presumably put the letter up and rescue the man and there's a bird sitting above and singing to the heavens and for story was trying close the basics yeah yeah okay okay okay simply put cinderella was a lonely pretty and good natured and in the servitude of an evil stepmother and two stepdaughters stepsisters and really won the whole story right okay i got to keep awake but i'll so there's the ball and the mother and the mother and the sisters are very worked up about the whole thing and going to try on the best costumes now cinderella is also worked up but she is going to the the mother is going to order to sit in the house and clean so off the mother and stepsisters go and cinderella is very forlorn but all the neighborhood household critters are gather and send her off in a fancy gown and i think this is where a good fairy appears to her and comes the pumpkin to a carriage and off she goes to the ball and naturally she is the first warden of all and has to be the various critters have told her that she has to return at midnight at midnight so she has a great time dancing with the prince who is totally in love with her now and but the clock strikes twelve and she runs out the door and leaves one shoe in the hall and he gets a carriage and rides home this is the carriage turning back into a pumpkin and her gorgeous gown turns to old rags and she returns to the house so sorry the day to day chores and there's back and forth but the wicked stepmother and the stepsisters try to dress up and present themselves to the princess emissaries and but i forget all the little details but she appears at the nick of time and the emissary puts the magic shoe on her and everything is hunky dory that's about it okay again again i watched the whole thing in my brain forever of course okay i'll get bread i'm sorry wheat bread and put the jelly peanut butter on the one side of the bread and hopefully apricot jelly on the other side together and eat it yes
