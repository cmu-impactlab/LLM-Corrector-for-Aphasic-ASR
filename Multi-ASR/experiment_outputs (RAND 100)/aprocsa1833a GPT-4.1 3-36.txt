not very good. that's my take on it. I can't think, I can't say what I want to. and spelling is just like I had to ask it, the phone, whatever her name was, to spell guard, g u a r d. but I couldn't spell and simple words, simple words are I can't think of it. but if I had to look up a dictionary or it light would go off and I would be able to spell it. but to think of it, I can't. even I still struggled to text because I can't think of the right spelling, not spelling, spelling and word phrase. she gets aggravated. well, the initial one, I remember we always kissed before we go to bed and well, she said that I didn't pucker. you know, right here. and I said, well, well, over and over again, I couldn't say just what. and I remember the ride up to the gas station for the er. I remember going in, but that was the last thing I remember until I woke up in vanderbilt ambulance. I was scared because I couldn't communicate and I had a deep depression, so I had had to train all over again just to brush my teeth. so it was just I guess that the surgeon said that the cluster of vessels right here and it burst and so I wanted to, when you released me, I wanted to drive. but anyway. yeah, and every time I talk, at least if we're in conversation right here, you know, the I don't know you and right here I am sweating and I didn't do that before the stroke. and so just to know that my glasses fogged up and I am starting to sweat. yep, but my friend, if we have to talk lengthy, I start to sweat too. but just like if I was going to lowe's, I mean, just to, I think I was embarrassed, I was even embarrassed to communicate because, you know, I stumble and can't think of the words and so every time I do that, sweat gets on. but anyway, you know. well, the speech therapist at tenova, but that was, I think it was six months, so but the insurance cut me off. I don't think so. it was still a challenge, even though, I don't know, was it september I got home, something like that. so I still had to learn all over again. I don't want to. well, she had me read and say the dumbest things over and over and over. it was, I don't know, just five, you know, four words over and over again, and five, four, I mean, six, talking. she said it and then I said, well, that sentence and I had to repeat. I don't know, do what? I do, my dad was a preacher and she, not she, he went to flint, michigan from florence, alabama in january of sixty seven. and he preached at her parents, was converted, and so I seeked her out. well, I was in henderson, tennessee, going to freed hardeman college, and that was a college there then. it's not now, it's a university. she was still in flint, michigan, so that had a long distance relationship. I started out preaching, but her dad was in general motors and he was a grinder, skill trades, and he said that the shops were hiring but the shops weren't hiring as well as he thought and we went up there in january of seventy three and I got in july thirty first. but that was a good move because we had retirement and the general motors stopped that retirement in probably o seven or o eight and I retired in o three. it was a good move. I just didn't want to be like my dad because preachers don't have a retirement. you go to work and you die. and if they don't have benefits, and so you could have had to probably hold down two jobs for benefits. so I just, I decided not to go along those lines. I am thankful. and the bill for the surgery was half a million and we only paid just over one thousand dollars. but medicare and blue cross, you know. medicare and blue cross paid for that. if I had to be a preacher, it's going, that's right. my glasses are fogging up. I'm making myself nervous. what do you mean, tell you a story. the boy is kicking the ball and it goes through the window and he lands on his father and his father throws it back at him. or are you going to discipline him. yes. well, no. first one, the picture was probably the child don't want the umbrella and mama said that you need an umbrella and probably they said the child you don't need one. so he goes out in the rain and he gets wet and goes back and gets the umbrella so he can get dry. really good. well, there's probably a little girl and the cat and the dog chased him up the tree and dad got up on the tree and he lost his ladder and he's probably doesn't need afraid to the drop get down and the fireman had to be called to get the dad and the cat down. yeah, somewhat. yeah, I don't know about that. I can't probably get the words out. cinderella's, I don't know if it was mother or stepmother or anyway two sisters are they're ugly and cinderella's beautiful so but they are into themselves and a stepmother treats the other girls nice and taking parties and cinderella had to scrub the floors and she was a stepmother who was harsh. so fairy godmother comes in the view and helps her out and turns a pumpkin into the chariot and horses and anyway animals and had glass slippers and she went to the ball and met the prince and she was late and the pumpkin turned back in and horses and men. so the prince tried to get the younger women to try on the slipper and the two ugly sisters, the feet, they tried to get stick it in their feet to the slipper and so cinderella had a fit to the slipper and lived happily ever after. get the bread, get the peanut butter and jar and jelly jar and get the knife and spread on the peanut butter and get a spoon and dig out the jelly and spoon it on the bread and eat it. that's right.
