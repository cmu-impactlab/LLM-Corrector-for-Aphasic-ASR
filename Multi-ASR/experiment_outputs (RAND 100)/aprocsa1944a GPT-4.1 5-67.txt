Okay well I don't think it is for my stroke, my first stroke was okay. At first I didn't couldn't say anything and then I went up and took therapy, speech therapy, and when I got it back and now with the second stroke I have some times when I want to say something and I can't say it and then way away. Oh yeah, I said it. So I had to work on that. Oh yeah, my first stroke, I didn't know what it was but I knew I was feeling, you know, uneasy and stuff and then it came on me and then on my second stroke I figured it was another one and so I knew some of the things I had to go to, it was the same, so I think I would say the second stroke because it was recent, you know, well recent than the first one. And then I had it and I went to the hospital, the one here, it was the one that I wanted to say it, I stayed in the hospital and I went to therapy, I went to speech and I went to OT and PT and I went to bathe myself, learn how to bathe myself and OT I would have some exercises to have it so I could do my hand and stuff. PT I learned how to walk again. And on the first stroke I came here too at what's the name of the Pi Beta, Pi Beta, what is it, the last year I had my stroke, my PT speaks and what is it, speech, OT and PT here, and I had, and it's very good. I had, that's what I say, I got all the way up and then I joined the, the, what, the thing that I joined, you know what I want, I knew I want to say it. I joined it then and I've been in there all the way and I have been in there about longer than anybody else. We had a banquet and I got a little plaque for that, some people had died and stuff like that but I was still the longest one there, but other people had joined this or had had more than other people, but I had more than all of them. So you know, and that's, I was very proud of that. And they gave me one, I had been in the book club longer than anybody. I had my first baby, it was a girl, and I had it, and I was very good, I thought I was a good mother and doing things for her. It was a joy to do that and now she is forty, forty five years, seven, forty seven years old, but I remember that's one of the things that I had in my life. No, I looked at it, you that old? And then I said, I'm seventy one, I guess you are that old. A boy, he is thirty. Yeah, yeah. Okay. The little boy is playing soccer and he's playing happy and then he said he he kicked the ball and the window, the neighbor's window broke because he kicked it through the window and then the man was sitting in the living room and the ball came through and he was shocked and the lamp fell over and stuff and then he got up and he said it's a soccer ball and he looked out the window to see who he kicked it. Oh yeah, okay, okay. Oh, this little boy or little girl, it looked like a, you look like a girl but he's going to school and his mama said take this umbrella because it looks like rain and he said I don't want to take that, I might lose it, it's not raining and as he goes to school it started to rain and it rained and then he came back and he was all wet and his mother said didn't I tell you to take the umbrella and so he got the umbrella and he started back to school. Okay, all right. The little girl got a cat that up and up, the cat is up in the tree and so he said please get my cat and she was riding on her tricycle and she tried to get the cat down but he wouldn't go and so he asked the man to get it down with the ladder but he didn't make it, he's still up in the tree and the cat's up in the tree and so they called the fire department and the dog is barking for the man but then the fire department came and they got the cat out of the tree. Yeah, there was a lot, I didn't mention the bird that's just sitting there looking, that's all he was gonna do. Okay, it's a story about Cinderella. He had her, his daddy was a widow because his wife died and she was very neat and pretty when she was a little girl and then his mother, his daddy said I'm going to marry this woman, she was a very treacherous woman and she wanted to marry him. So they married and she had two little girls, very very very ugly girls and so then daddy died and she said she was going to run the house and she didn't want Cinderella to have pretty clothes, she wanted her to have rags and then she said I don't have a maid to run this house so you will be the maid and you will be my maid and the girls too and then by this time they had grown up and so she fixed the wood, the fire, and did the housework and cooked the breakfast and stuff for them, anything they wanted she had to do it and so she lived up in the attic and when she had the animals to talk to her, the horse and the rats and the cat and things, that's all she had to talk to. And then telegram came because the king wants his son to marry so he had a ball and so he tried to see who he want to marry but so the two girls and the mother got some fancy clothes and everything to go to the ball because she wanted one of them to marry the prince. So the mother had left a dress for her and said I will use this, my mother's dress, and I will fix it up and then when the mother and two girls had to get ready and dressed up and go to the ball and then Cinderella came down, I said I want to go too and they was very very ugly, I said oh you want to go, you can't go and then she, the dress she had, they pitted, they smashed it. After they had made the dress messy and torn and they went to the ball and then the mother put Cinderella upstairs I think and so she couldn't go out and then the fairy godmother came and Cinderella looked and she told them they wouldn't let me go to the ball and so she said just a minute, I'll see about this and so she got her a dress, a pretty dress, and made the pumpkin and the rats and the cats now, made them the footstool and the driver and said you go into the ball but you must get back by twelve o'clock, all this fixed for you will be gone. And so they all went to the ball and Cinderella came and the old, old, old, the old battle axe was looking and the girls were too, they said where's that girl going at the ball and looking at the prince looking at her and so the prince danced with her for all the night and so she wanted to know, he wanted to know what her name is and where is she but she didn't tell and then she had some pretty shoes, they were glass shoes and the clock was chiming twelve o'clock so that she gotta let go because the fairy godmother said if you don't get out there by twelve you'll have all that stuff, it will go back. So she was going and running and running and one of the shoes was left on the steps and she was running and running because she had to get out of there and went back, the pumpkin and the rats and the horse, they all went back to what they were. And so then the girl and so the old mother put her up in the, they came around her house and said I wanted you to look at this shoe to see if you can wear it and the other one, she said I will fit it but it didn't fit either and then the other shoe and the mother, the other shoe and they found it was her and so they had a big wedding and they lived happy ever after. The best retelling of Cinderella, I think, you know, I was a teacher and I would tell all kind of stories. I was gonna ask if you ever told your students or your kids those kinds of stories. Yeah, the kids and everything. Well, I'm sure they loved it when you did. Oh yeah, thank you, you even reminded me of some details that I forgot. Alright, yeah, that was great. Okay, I have one more talking thing for you and then we're gonna do the language test and then just a couple more things. Okay, so this is gonna be a little bit different. I want you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Oh, okay. Alright, you get the cabinet and you get some bread, two pieces of bread out of the, the, what is it, the bread is in the, I say sack but that's not the, what the bread stays in. And so the peanut butter and the two pieces of bread and okay, you get a piece of bread and you, oh, you need a knife and then you put and then you put the bread and you put another, the other piece on the peanut butter and then you eat it. Yeah, that's the way I think I say it.
