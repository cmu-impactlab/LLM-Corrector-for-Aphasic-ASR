there from somewhere between two and three days eventually my daughter came in so yeah it was very long i couldn't move i feel very more or less blessed by my recovery because i got up and moved eventually months later i couldn't walk for about i think about four months three or four months but i have been doing the things i was asked to do and i read and i write and i draw and i walk a deal and i'm doing yoko at this point about twice a week two or three times a week you look very brightly yeah well one on one therapy just sit down and not exactly it's more or less being connected to a phase of an group but occasionally for two or three months at a time one on one so just totally random okay so many different things are important to me i don't know really what to draw from the every week is i experience several things that are important really mind boggling and important so okay currently i think i'm very concerned about the national political mood in this country and i'm working i'm concentrating on something i can do on a daily basis that takes to pressing out our first and also i'm praying and talking with every people about it so that's very current and very important at
