house and she didn't want cinderella to have pretty clothes she wanted her to have rags and then she said i don't have a maid to run this house so you will be the maid and you will be my maid and the girls too and then by this time they had grown up and so she fixed the wood the fire and did housework and cooked breakfast and stuff for them anything they wanted she had to do it and so she lived up in the attic and when she had the animals to talk to her the horse and the rats and the cat and things that's all she had to talk to and then a telegram came because the king wants his son to marry so he had a ball and so he tried to see who he want to marry but so the two girls and the mother got some fancy clothes and everything to go to the ball because she wanted one of them to marry the prince so the mother had left a dress for her and said i will use this my mother's dress and i will fix it up and then when the mother and two girls had to get ready and dressed up and go to the ball and then cinderella came down i want to go too and they were very very ugly i said oh you want to go you can't go and then the dress she had they pitted smashed it and so after they had made the dress messy and torn and they went to the ball and then the mother put cinderella upstairs i think and so she couldn't go out and then the fairy godmother came and she told them they wouldn't let me go to the ball and so she said just a minute i'll see about this and so she got her a dress a pretty dress and made the pumpkin and the rats and the cats made them the footstool and the driver and said you

that i forgot alright yeah that was great okay i have one more talking thing for you okay and then we're gonna do the language test and then just a couple more things okay so this is gonna be a little bit different okay i want you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich oh okay alright you get the cabinet and you get some bread two pieces of bread out of the what is it the bread is in the i say sack but that's not the what the bread stays in and so the peanut butter and the two pieces of bread and okay you get a piece of bread and you oh you need a knife and then you put the bread and you put another the other piece on the peanut butter and then you eat it yeah okay this is how that's the way i think i say i say it
