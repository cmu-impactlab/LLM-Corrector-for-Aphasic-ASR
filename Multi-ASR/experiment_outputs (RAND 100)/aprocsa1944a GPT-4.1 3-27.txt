looked at you you that old and then I said I'm seventy one I guess you are that old a boy he is thirty yeah the little boy is playing soccer and he's playing and then he said he he kicked the ball and the window the neighbor's window broke because he kicked it through the window and then the man was sitting in the living room and the ball came through and he was shocked and the lamp fell over and stuff and then he got up and he said it's a soccer ball and he looked out the window to see who he kicked it oh yeah OK OK oh this little boy or little girl the it looked like a you look like a girl but he's going to school and his mama said take this umbrella because it looks like rain and he said I don't want to I don't want to take that I might lose it it's not raining and as he goes to school it started to rain and it rained and then he came back and he looked he was all wet and his mother said didn't I tell you to take the umbrella and so he got the umbrella and he started back to school OK the little girl got a cat that up and up the cat is up in the tree and so he said please get my cat and she was riding on her tricycle and she tried to get the cat down but he wouldn't go and so he asked the man to get it down with the ladder but he didn't make it he's still up in the tree and the cat's up in the tree and so they called the fire department and the dog is barking for the man but then the fire department came and they got the cat out of the tree yeah there was a lot I didn't mention the bird that's just sitting there looking that's all he was going to do OK it's a story about Cinderella he had her his daddy was a widow 'cause his wife died and she was very neat and pretty when she was a little girl and then then his mother his daddy said I'm going to marry this woman she was a very treacherous woman and she wanted to marry him so they married and she had two little girls very very very ugly girls and so then daddy died and all she said she was going to run the house and she didn't want Cinderella to have pretty clothes she wanted her to have rags and then she said I don't have a maid to run this house so you will be the maid and you will be my maid and the girls too and then by this time they had grown up and so she fixed the the wood the fire and did the housework and cooked the breakfast and stuff for them anything they wanted she had to do it and so she lived up in the attic and when she had the animals to talk to her the horse and the rats and the cat and things that's all she had to talk to and then a telegram came because the king wants his son to marry so he had a ball and so he could see who you want to marry but so the two girls and the mother got some fancy clothes and everything to go to the ball because she wanted one of them to marry the prince so the mother had left a dress for her and see I will use this my mother's dress and I will fix it up and then when the mother and two girls had to get ready and dressed up and go to the ball and then Cinderella came down I said I want to go too and oh they was very very ugly and I said oh you want to go you can't go and out she the dress she had they pitted she pitted it out they smashed it I think after they had made the dress messy and torn and they went to the ball and then the mother put Cinderella upstairs I think she couldn't go out and then the fairy godmother came and Cinderella looked and she told them they wouldn't let me go to the ball and so she said just a minute I'll see about this and so she got her a dress a pretty dress and made the pumpkin and the rats and the cats now made them the footstool and the driver and thing and you go into the ball but you must get back by twelve o'clock all this fixed for you will be gone and so they all went to the ball and Cinderella came and the old old old man the old battle axes was looking and the girls were too they said where's that girl going at the ball and looking at the prince looking at her and so the prince danced with her for all the night and so she wanted to know he wanted to know what her name is and where she is but she didn't tell and then she had some pretty shoes they were they were glass shoes and so and the clock was chiming twelve o'clock so that she got to let go because she said the fairy godmother said if you don't get out there by twelve you'll have all that stuff it will go back so she was going and running and running and one of the shoes were left on the steps and she was running and running because she had to get out of there and went back the pumpkin and the rats and the horse they all went back to what they were and so then the girl and so the old mother put her up in the in the they came around her house and said I wanted you to look to you to look at this shoe to see if you can wear it and the other one she said I will fit it but it didn't fit either and then the other shoe and the mother's other shoe and they found it was her and so they had a big wedding and they lived happy ever after yeah the best retelling of Cinderella I think you know I was a teacher and I would tell all kind of stories yeah the kids yeah kids and yeah yeah I'm sure they loved it when you did oh yeah thank you you even reminded me of some details that I forgot alright yeah OK I have one more thing for you and then we're going to do the language test and then just a couple more things OK so this is going to be a little bit different I want you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich oh OK alright you get the cabinet and you get some bread two pieces of bread out of the the what is it the bread is in the the I say sack but that's not the what the bread stays in and so the peanut butter and the two pieces of bread and OK you get a piece of bread and you oh you need a knife and then you put and then you put the bread and you put another the other piece on the peanut butter and then you eat it yeah is this the way I think I say it
