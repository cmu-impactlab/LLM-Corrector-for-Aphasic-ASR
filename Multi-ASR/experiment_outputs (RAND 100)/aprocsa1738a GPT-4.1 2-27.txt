Okay, very erratic. I'm close to ten years since the stroke, and I've been more or less talking for the last seven. At times, this time of year I can wake up and feel fine and pronounce things very carefully. Other times, I'm often in fall, some about back and forth, more than others past year or so. Anything else? Late in December, I was alone in my small house behind my front door. I suddenly, once I say at this point, I'll say blank, but going back as far beyond this, I couldn't get a hold of myself. I was in the house, very cold. It's very messy, and I sat there from somewhere between two and three days. Eventually my daughter came in, so yeah, it was very long. I couldn't move. I felt very, more or less blessed by my recovery because I got up and moved eventually, months later. I couldn't walk for about, I think, about four months, three or four months. But I have been doing the things I was asked to do and I read and I write and I draw and I walk, and I'm doing Yoko at this point about twice a week, two or three times a week. Oh, okay. You look very brightly, yeah, well, one-on-one therapy, just sit down and not exactly, it's more or less being connected to a vision of and in group, but occasionally for two or three months at a time, one on one, so just totally at random. Okay, so many different things are important to me. I don't know really what to draw from. Every week is, I experience several things that are important, really mind-bogglingly important. So, okay, currently I think I'm very concerned about the national political mood in this country and yeah. I'm concentrating on something I can do on a daily basis that takes the pressing off and also I'm praying and talking with every people about it, so that's very current and very important at the moment. So, yeah, not too many church lately. I've been thinking about a great deal on maybe hoping to return to California for another maybe one to two years where, you know, media and powers for right near Long Beach. By the way, Rajanaka is almost, almost my favorite beach long ago. It's dear for this tide and I'll think about it. The second place, I have to think about it. It's long ago, it used to be very wide. I hadn't been there for a while, so yeah, yeah. First cousin living on the beach in Man. The boy is kicking the ball, it's going through the window, it's dropping next to a young, an older man who gristle blood. Basic, and then very basically, the young boy has no umbrella from the mother. He says goodbye, goes out and it starts raining. He runs back and it's all wet. The mother looks a bit scoldingly, so he takes the brother and he walks to school, I guess, and story very basically. The little girl is trying to reach the kitty cat in the branches. There's a letter and a tricycle. I see her closer to the tree as a forlorn looking man looking out as the dog barks up at him and the two farm are running with another letter from the frog truck to presumably put the letter and rescued the man. And it's a bird sitting of open singing to heaven and this story was trying the basic, yeah, yeah, okay, okay, simply put, now. Senator was alarmingly pretty and good-natured and in the servitude of evil stepmother and two stepdaughters, stepsisters, you know. Really want the whole story, right? Okay, I got to keep awake, but I'll try. So there's a ball and the mother and the mother and the sisters are very worked out about the whole thing and going to try on the best costumes now. Cinderella has also woke her up, but she is going to, the mother is going to order to sit in the house and clean, so off the mother San Francisco and Cinderella, but all the neighborhood household careers are gathered in, send her off in a fancy gown and I think this was a good prayer appeals to her and comes mushroom, sorry, the pumpkin into a carriage and off she goes to the ball and naturally she is the first warden of ball and has to be the various courts have told her that she has to return at midnight. So she has a great time dancing with the prince who is totally in love with her now, but the clock strikes twelve, sorry, and she runs out the door and leaves one shoe and enters and gets a carriage and rides home, and this is the carriage turning back into a pumpkin and her gorgeous gown turns to old rags and returns to the hospital, sorry, the day-to-day chores. And it's back and forth but the wicked step and the sisters try to dress up and present themselves to the princess emissaries, but I forget all the little details, but she appears and look at nick at time and the emissary puts the magic shoe on her and everything is hunky dory. That's about it. Okay, again and again, I watched the whole damn thing for like, you know, my brain for, of course, okay, cool, yeah, I'll get bread, I'm sorry, wheat bread, and put the jelly, peanut butter on the one side of the bread and hopefully apricot jelly on the other side together and eat it, yes.
