not pretty good. that's my take on it. I can't think I can't say what I want to. spelling is just like I had to ask it the phone whatever her name was to spell guard g u a r d. but I couldn't spell and simple words simple words are I can't think of it. but I if I had look up a dictionary or light would go off and I would be able to spell it. but to think of it I can't. even I still struggled to text because I can't think of the right spelling spelling and word phrase so she gets aggravated. well the initial one I remember we always kissed before we go to bed and well she said that I didn't pucker you know right here and and I said well well over and over again I could I couldn't say just and I remember the ride up to the gas station for the ER and I remember going in but that was the last thing I remember until I woke up in Vanderbilt ambulance. I just I was scared because I couldn't communicate and I just had a deep depression so and I had had to train all over again just to brush my teeth so it was just I guess that the surgeon said that you know the cluster of vessels right here and it burst and so I wanted to when released me I wanted to drive. but anyway yeah and every time I talk least if we could conversation right here any you know the I don't know you and right here I am sweating and I didn't do that before the stroke and I am starting to sweat. yep. but my friend if we have to talk lengthy I start to sweat too. but just like if I was going to Lowe's I mean just just to I think I was even I'm embarrassed to communicate because you know I stumble and can't think of the words and so every time I do that sweat yeah so but anyway yeah well the speech therapist at Tenova but that was I think it was six months so but the insurance cut me off. I don't think so was that well it was still a challenge even though I got well I don't know was it September I got home something like that so it's still had had to learn all over again. I don't work. yeah. well she had had me read and say the dumbest things over and over and over. was I don't know just the five you know four four words over and over again and five four I mean six talking. she said it and then I say well that sentence and I had to repeat. I don't know do what. I had to my dad was a preacher and she not she he went to Flint Michigan from Florence Alabama in January of sixty seven. and he preached at her parents was converted and so I seeked her out. but anyway. well I was in Henderson Tennessee going to Freed Hardeman College and that was a college there then it's not now it's a university but she was still in Flint Michigan so that had a long distance relationship. so I started out preaching but her dad was in General Motors and he was a grinder a skilled trades and he said that the shops were hiring but the shop he the shops weren't hiring as what he thought and we took we went up there in January of seventy three and I got out in July thirty first. so but that was a good move because we had retirement and the General Motors stopped that retirement in probably o seven or o eight and I retired in o three. so it was a good move. I just didn't want to be like my dad because preachers all don't you have you don't have a retirement. you go to work and you die. and if they don't have benefits and so you could had had to probably hold down two jobs for benefits. so I just I decided not to go all on those lines. I am thankful. so and the bill for the surgery was half a million and we only paid just over one thousand dollars. but Medicare and Blue Cross you know. yeah. Medicare and Blue Cross paid for that. yeah. if I had had it be a preacher is going that's right. my glasses are fogging up. I'm making myself nervous. what do you mean tell you a story. the boy's kicking the ball and it goes through the window and he lands on his father and his father throws it back at him or he going to discipline him. yes. well no. first one picture is probably the child don't want the umbrella and mom said that you need to umbrella and probably they said the child you don't need one so he goes out in the rain and he gets wet and goes back and gets the umbrella so he can get dry. really good. well this probably the little girl had a the cat and the dog chased him up the tree and dad got up on the tree and he lost his ladder and he's probably doesn't need afraid to the drop get down and farmer had be called to get the dad and the cat down. yeah somewhat. yeah I don't know about that. I can't probably get the words out. Cinderella's I don't know if it was mother or stepmother or anyway two sisters are they're ugly and Cinderella's beautiful so but they're into themselves and so a stepmother treats the other girls nice and take them to parties and Cinderella had to scrub the floors and she was stepmother was harsh and so very God mother comes into view and helps her out and turns a pumpkin into the chariot and horses and anyway animals and have glass slippers and she went to the ball and met the prince and she was late and the pumpkin turned back in and the horses and the men. so the prince tried to get the younger women to try on the slipper and the two ugly sisters the feet they tried to get stick it in their feet to the slipper and so Cinderella had fit to the slipper and lived happily ever after. get the bread get the peanut butter and jar and jelly jar and get the knife and spread on the peanut butter and get a spoon and dig out the jelly and spoon it on the bread and eat it.
