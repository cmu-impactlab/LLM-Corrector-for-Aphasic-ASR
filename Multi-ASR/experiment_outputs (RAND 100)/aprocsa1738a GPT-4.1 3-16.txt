Okay very erratic I'm close to ten years since the stroke and I've been more or less talking for the last seven and at times this tenth year I can wake up and feel fine and pronounce things very carefully other times I'm off in the fall somewhere about back and forth more than others this past year or so anything else yeah it was late in December I was alone in my small house behind my friend with my daughters and I suddenly went I would say at this point I'll say blank but going back as far beyond this I couldn't get a hold of myself and I was in the house it was very cold it's very messy and I sat there from somewhere between two and three days eventually my daughter came in so yeah it was very long I couldn't move I feel very more or less blessed by my recovery because I got up and moved eventually months later I couldn't walk for about I think about four months three or four months but I have been doing the things I was asked to do and I read and I write and I draw and I walk a deal and I'm doing yoga at this point about twice a week two or three times a week you look very brightly yeah well one on one therapy just sit down and not exactly it's more or less being connected to a phase of a group but occasionally for two or three months at a time one on one so just totally random okay so many different things are important to me I don't know really what to draw from every week is I experience several things that are important really mind bogglingly important so currently I think I'm very concerned about the national political mood in this country and I'm working I'm concentrating on something I can do on a daily basis that takes the president out of office and also I'm praying and talking with every people about it so that's very current and very important at the moment so not too many churches lately I've been thinking about a great deal maybe hoping to return to California for another maybe one to two years so where I'm new media in Powell Springs right near long Redondo is almost almost my favorite beach long ago I sit there for this time around and I'll think about it it's second place I have to think about it as long as long ago wide it used to be very wide I hadn't been for a while so yeah yeah first cousin living in on the beach in Manhattan Beach so okay the boy is kicking the ball is going through the window has dropped me next to a young older man who now grabs it below that's basic okay I've been very basically the young boy has no umbrella from the mother he says goodbye goes out and it starts raining he runs back and it's all wet the mother looks a bit scoldingly so he takes to the brother and walks to school I guess and read stories okay and again very basically the little girl is trying to reach the kitty cat in the branches there's a ladder and a tricycle next to her closer to the tree is a forlorn looking man looking out as the dog barks up at him and the two farmers are running with another letter from the fire truck to presumably put the letter up and rescue the man and there's a bird sitting above and singing to the heavens and the story was trying close the basic yeah yeah okay okay okay simply put now Cinderella was a lonely pretty and good natured and in the servitude of an evil stepmother and two stepdaughters step sisters and really won the whole story right I've got to keep awake but I'll try so there's a ball and the mother and the sisters are very worked up about the whole thing and going to try on the best costumes now Cinderella was also worked up but she is going to the mother is going to order to sit in the house and clean so off the mother and step sisters go and Cinderella is very forlorn but all the neighborhood household critters are gathered and send her off in a fancy gown and I think this is where a good fairy appears to her and comes the pumpkin into a carriage and off she goes to the ball and naturally she is the first warden of all and has to be the various couriers have told her that she has to return at midnight so has a great time dancing with the prince who is totally in love with her now and but the star clock strikes twelve and she runs out the door and leaves one shoe in the entrance and gets a carriage and rides home as the carriage is turning back into a pumpkin and her gorgeous gown turns to old rags and she returns to the house so sorry the day to day chores and there's a back and forth about the wicked stepmother and the stepsisters try to dress up and present themselves to the princess emissaries but I forget all the little details but she appears at the nick of time and the emissary puts the magic shoe on her and everything is hunky dory that's about it okay again as I again and again I watched the whole thing it's in my brain forever too bad of course okay cool I'll get bread I'm sorry wheat bread and put the jelly peanut butter on the one side of the bread and hopefully apricot jelly on the other side together and eat it
