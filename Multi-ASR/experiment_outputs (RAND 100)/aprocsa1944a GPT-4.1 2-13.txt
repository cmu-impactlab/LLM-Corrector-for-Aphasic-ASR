Okay. Well, I don't, I don't think it, as for my stroke, my first stroke was okay. I, at first I didn't, couldn't say anything and then I went up and up and took therapy, speech therapy, and when I went, I got it back. And now, with the second stroke, I, I have, I have some times when I want to say something and I can't say it and then way, way away, "Oh yeah, I, I said it." You know? So, I have to, have to work on that. Oh yeah. I, I was, I was, my first stroke, I didn't have, I didn't know what it was, but I knew I was feeling, you know, uneasy and, and stuff and, and then I, it, it came on me. And now, on my second stroke, I, I, I, I figured it was another one and so, I knew some of the things I had to go do. It was that same, so I, I, I, I think I would say the second stroke because I, it was recent, you know, well, recent than the first one. And then I, I had it and I went to, the, the, it was the one that, it was, I wanted to say I, I stayed in the hospital and I went to therapy. I went to speaks and, I went to OT and PT. And I went, I went to bathe myself, learn how to bathe myself and, and OT I was, I would have some, some exercises to have it so I could do my hand and stuff. PT, I learned how to walk again. Yeah. And on the, on the first stroke, I, I, I came here too at the, at, what's, what's the name of the, the Pi Beta, Pi Beta, what is it, the last, yeah. I had my stroke, my PT, speaks and, what is it, speech, OT and PT here and I had, and it was very good. I had, that's what I say. I got all the way up and then I, I joined the, the, the, what, the thing that I want, I joined, you know what I, you know I want, I knew I wanted to say it. I joined it then and I've been in there all the way. And I, I have been in there about longer than anybody else. Yeah. We had a, a banquet and I, I got the, a little plaque for that. But some, some people had died and stuff like that, but I was still the longest one there, but somebody, other people had joined, just joined or has had more than other people, but I had more than all of them. And I have been in the book club longer than anybody else. Yeah. Oh, I had, I had my first baby, it was a girl. And I, I, I had her and, and I was very good, a good mother in doing things for her. It was a joy to do that and now she is, forty, forty-five years, forty-seven years old. But I remember this. That's one of the things that I had in my life. Right. No. Not like that. You get a, you get old and then I say, "I'm, I'm forty, I'm seventy-one." I guess you are that, that old. When a, a, a boy, he is, thirty. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. The boy, the little boy is playing soccer and he's playing happy. And then, he said, he, he, he kicked the ball and the, the window, the neighbor's window broke 'cause he kicked it through the window. And then, the man was sitting in the living room and the ball came through and he was shocked. And the lamp fell over and stuff. And then, he got up and he said, "It's a soccer ball." And he looked out the window to see who he kicked it. Oh yeah. Okay. The little girl, it looked like a boy or girl, but he's going to school and his mama said, "Take this umbrella because it looks like rain." And he said, "I don't want to take that. I might lose it. It's not raining." And as he goes to school, it started to rain and it rained and then he came back and he looked, he was all wet. And his mother said, "Didn't I tell you to take the umbrella?" And so, he got the umbrella and he started back to school. Okay. The little girl got a cat that up and up, the cat is up in the tree. And so, he said, "Please get my cat." And she was riding on her tricycle and she tried to get the cat down, but he wouldn't go. And then so, he, he, he asked the man to get it down with the ladder, but he didn't make it. He's still up in the tree and the cat's up in the tree. And so, they called the fire department and the dog is barking for the man. But then, the fire department came and they got the cat out of the tree. Yeah. There was a lot and then mentioning the bird that's just sitting there looking. He can't, that's all he was gonna do. Yeah. Okay. This is a story about Cinderella. He had her. His daddy was a widow 'cause his wife died and he, she was very neat and pretty when she was a little girl. And then his daddy said, "I'm going to marry this woman." She was a very treacherous woman and she wanted to marry him. So, they married and she had two little girls. Very, very ugly girls. And so, then the daddy died and she said she was gonna run the house. And she didn't want Cinderella to have pretty clothes. She wanted her to have rags. And then she said, "I don't have a maid to run this house, so you will be the maid and you will be my maid and the girls too." And then by this time, they had grown up. And so she fixed the, the wood, the fire, and did the housework, and cooked the breakfast and stuff for them. Anything they wanted, she had to do it. And so, she lived up in the attic and when she had the animals to talk to her, the horse and the rats and the cat and things. That's all she had to talk to. And then a telegram came because the king wants his son to marry, so he had a ball and so he could see, "Well, who will you want to marry?" But the two girls and their mother got some fancy clothes and everything to go to the ball because she wanted one of them to marry the prince. So, the mother had left a dress for her and said, "I will use this, this, my mother's dress, and I will fix it up." And then when the mother and the two girls had to get ready and dressed up and go to the ball, and then Cinderella came down and said, "I want to go too," and they were very, very ugly. And they said, "Oh, you want to go? You can't go." And then out, she put the dress she had, they pitted it out, they smashed it, I think. And so after they had made the dress messy and torn and they went to the ball and then the mother put Cinderella upstairs, I think. And so, she couldn't go out and then the Fairy Godmother came and Cinderella looked and she told her, "They wouldn't let me go to the ball." And so she said, "Just a minute, I'll see about this." And so, she got her a dress, a pretty dress, and made the pumpkin and the rats and the cats now, made them the footstalls and the driver and thing. And said, "You're going to the ball, but you must get back by twelve o'clock or all this I've fixed for you will be gone." And so they all went to the ball and Cinderella came and the old man, the old baddie was looking and the girls were too. They said, "Who is that girl who's going at the ball?" And look at the prince looking at her. And so, the prince danced with her for all of the night and he wanted to know who her, what her name is and where is she, but she didn't tell him. And then, she had some pretty shoes, they were glass shoes and the clock was chiming twelve o'clock so that she gotta let go because the Fairy Godmother said, "If you don't get out of there by twelve, all that stuff, it will go back." So she was going and running and running, and one of the shoes were left on the steps and she was running and running because she was gotta get out of there. And the pumpkin and the rats and all the toys, they all went back to what they were. And so, then the girl. And so, the old mother put her up in the, they came around her house and said, "Where is she at? I wanted you to look at this shoe to see if you can wear it." And the other one, so she said, "I will fit it." But it didn't fit either. And then the other shoe and the mother's other shoe. And they found it was her. And so, they had a big wedding and they lived happy ever after. The best retelling of Cinderella I think I've heard. Oh, I was a teacher and I would tell all the kind of stories. Yeah. I was gonna ask if you ever told your students or your kids the Cinderella story. Yeah, kids and everything. Okay. Well, I'm sure they loved it when you did. Oh yeah. Thank you. You even reminded me of some details that I forgot. Yeah. It was great. Okay. I have one more talking thing for you. Okay. And then we're going to do the language test. Okay. And then just a couple more things and then we'll, okay. So this is gonna be a little bit different. I want you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Oh, okay. All right. You, you, you get the cabinet. And you get some bread, two pieces of bread out of the, the, the, what is it, the bread stays in. Okay. The peanut butter and the two pieces of bread, and okay. You get a piece of bread and you, oh, you need a knife. And then you put it, and then you put the bread, and you put another, the other piece on the peanut butter, and then you eat it. Okay. Is this, is, that's the way I think I said it.
