Well, I don't think it is for my stroke. My first stroke was okay. At first I couldn't say anything, and then I went up and took therapy, speech therapy, and when I went, I got it back. And now, with the second stroke, I have, I have some times when I want to say something and I can't say it, and then way, way away. Oh yeah, I said it, you know. So I have to, have to work on that. Oh yeah, I was, my first stroke, I didn't know what it was, but I knew I was feeling, you know, uneasy and stuff, and then it came on me. And then on my second stroke, I figured it was another one, and so I knew some of the things I had to go through, it was the same, so I think I would say the second stroke because it was recent, you know, well, recent but then the first one, you know, and then I had it and I went to the, the, it was the one that, it was, I wanted to say it, I stayed in that hospital and I went to therapy, I went to speaks and I went to speed, and I went to OT and PT, and I went to raise myself, learn how to bathe myself, and in OT, I would have some exercises to have it so I could do my hand and stuff, and in PT, I learned how to walk again. Yeah. And on the first stroke, I came here too, at, what's the name, the PI Beta, what is it, the last, yeah. I had my stroke, my PT, speaks, and what is it, speaks, OT, and PT here, and it was very good. I had, that's what I say, I got all the way up, and then I joined the, the, the, what, the thing that I joined, you know, what, you know, I want, I knew I wanted to say it. I joined it then, and I've been in there all the way. And I have been in there about longer than anybody else. Yeah, we had a banquet, and I got a little plaque for that, but some people had died and stuff like that. But I was still the longest one there, but some other people had joined this year, and they've been there, but I have been in the book club longer than anybody else, you know. I had my first baby, it was a girl, and I had her, and I was very good, I thought I was a good mother and doing things for her, it was a joy to do that, and now she is forty-five, forty-seven years old, but I remember that's one of the things that I had in my life. I looked at her and said, you're the old, and then I said, I'm forty-one, I guess you are the old. One, a boy, he is thirty. Yeah. Okay. The little boy is playing soccer, and he's playing happy, and then he kicked the ball and the neighbor's window broke because he kicked it through the window, and then the man was sitting in the living room and the ball came through, and he was shocked, and the lamp fell over and stuff, and then he got up and he said, it's a soccer ball, and he looked out the window to see who kicked it. Oh yeah. Okay, okay. The little girl, it looked like a boy or girl, but he's going to school, and his mama said, take this umbrella because it looked like rain, and he said, I don't want to take that, I might lose it, it's not raining, and as he goes to school, it started to rain, and it rained, and then he came back and he looked, he was all wet, and his mother said, didn't I tell you to take the umbrella, and so he got the umbrella, and he started back to school. Okay, okay. The little girl got a cat that up, and the cat is up in the tree, and so he said, please get my cat, and she was riding on her tricycle, and she tried to get the cat down, but he wouldn't go, and so he asked the man to get it down with the ladder, but he didn't make it, he's still up in the tree, and the cat's up in the tree, and so they called the fire department, and the dog is barking for the man, but then the fire department came and they got the cat out of the tree. Yeah, there was a lot, I didn't mention the bird, that's just sitting there looking, that's all he was gonna do. Okay. It's a story about Cinderella. He had her, his daddy was a widow because his wife died, and she was very neat and pretty when she was a little girl, and then his daddy said, I'm going to marry this woman, she was a very treacherous woman, and she wanted to marry him, so they married, and she had two little girls, very, very ugly girls, and so then the daddy died and all, she said she was gonna run the house and she didn't want Cinderella to have pretty clothes, she wanted her to have rags, and then she said, I don't have a maid to run this house, so you will be the maid, and you will be my maid and the girls, too. And then by this time, they had grown up, and so she fixed the wood, the fire, and did the housework and cooked the breakfast and stuff for them, anything they wanted, she had to do it. And so she lived up in the attic, and when she had the animals to talk to her, the horse and the rats and the cat and things, that's all she had to talk to. And then a telegram came because the king wants his son to marry, so he had a ball, and so they trying to see who he want to marry. But the two girls and the mother got some fancy clothes and everything to go to the ball because she wanted one of them to marry the prince. So the mother had left a dress for her and said, I will use this, this my mother's dress, and I will fix it up. And then when the mother and the two girls had to get ready and dressed up and go to the ball, and then Cinderella came down and said, I want to go too. And they were very, very ugly and said, oh, you want to go, you can't go. And then the dress she had, they petted it, they smashed it, I can't. And so after they had made the dress messy and torn, and they went to the ball, and then the mother put her up in the, they came around her house and said, I wanted you to look, look to you to look at this shoe to see if you can wear it, and all the other one, so she said, I was fitted, but it didn't fit either. And then the other shoe, and the mother, the other shoe, and they found it was her, and so they had a big wedding and they lived happily ever after. The best retelling of Cinderella, I think I've heard. Okay. All right, you get the cabinet and you get some bread, two pieces of bread out of the, the bread is in the, the bread stay in, and they get the peanut butter and the two pieces of bread and okay, you get a piece of bread and you, oh, you need a knife and then you put the bread and you put another, the other piece on the peanut butter, and then you eat it.
