Not very good. That's my take on it. I can't think I can't say what I want to, you know, and spelling is just like I had to ask the phone were whatever name it was to spell guard G U A R D but I couldn't spell it and simple words simple words are I can't think of it and but I if I had look it up in dictionary or light will go off and I won't be able to spell it but but to think of it I can't even I still still struggle to text because I can't think of the right spelling not spelling and spelling and and word phrase she gets aggravated so yeah well the the initial one I remember we always kiss before we go to bed and well she said that I did pucker is just you know right here and and I said well well over and over and again I couldn't I couldn't so and I I remember that the ride up to the gas station for the ER I went I remember going in but that was the last thing I remember until I woke up in Vanderbilt ambulance I just I was scared because I couldn't communicate and I had a deep depression so I had had to train all over again just to brush my teeth so it was just I guess that surgeon said that you know they cluster of vessels right here and it burst and so that I I I wanted to when released me I I wanted to drive but anyway yeah and every time I talk at least that if were conversation right here and you know the the I don't know you and right here I am sweating and I I didn't I didn't do that before the stroke and so just to know that my my glasses fogged up and I I'm starting to sweat yeah but but the my friend if if we have to talk a lengthy I I started to sweat too but just like if I was going to Lowe's I mean I mean just just to I think I I was I was even I'm embarrassed to communicate because you know I stumbled and and can't think of the words and and so every time I do that sweat yeah so but anyway you know well the speech therapist at to Nova but that was I think it was six months so but Inur cut cut me off no I don't think so was it well it was still a challenge even even though go I don't know it was in September I got home something like that so it's still had had to learn all over again I don't want to yeah well she had me read the say say the dumbest things over and over and over well I don't know just a five you know forty four words over and over again then fifty four I mean six talking she said it and then I said well the the sentence and and I had to repeat I don't know do that I do my my dad was a preacher and she that she he went to Flint Michigan from Florence Alabama and in January of sixty seven and or she he preached that her parents was converted and so I I seeked her out but well I was in Henderson Tennessee going to Fred Hardiman College and it was a college there then it's not now it's a university but the she was still in Flint Michigan so that had a long distance relationship so and I I started out preaching and but but her dad was a in General Motors and he was a grinder skilled trades and he said that the shops were hiring but the shop he the harps weren't hiring as well as he he thought and we took we went all up there in January of seventy three and and I got out in July thirty first so but that was a good move because we had retirement and the General Motors stopped that retirement in probably o seven or two thousand eight and I retired in o three that was a good move I just didn't want to be like my dad because preachers don't you have you don't have a retirement you go to work or you die and if if they they don't have a benefits and so you could I had to probably hold down two jobs for benefits so I just I decided not to go along those lines I am thankful so and and and the bill brain surgery has half of me and the we we only paid just over one thousand dollars well but Medicaid and Blue Cross you know oh yeah Medicare and Blue Cross paid for that yeah if I had had to be a preacher he's going to that's right my glasses are fogging out I may make myself nervous well what do you mean to tell his story the boys kicking the ball and and it goes through the window and he lands on his father and his father throws it back at him or or you going to disciplining yes no first one pictures probably a child don't want to the umbrella and mama said that you need umbrella and probably they said the child you don't need one so he he goes out in the ring and he gets wet and goes back and gets the umbrella so so he could get dry well there's probably a little girl and the cat and the dog chased him up the tree and dad got up on the tree and he lost his ladder and and he's done probably done free to the drop get down and the firemen had to be called to get the dad and the cat down somewhat now I don't know about that I can't probably get the words out Cinderella's I don't know if his mother or a stepmother or two sisters are they're ugly and and Cinderella is beautiful so but they're into themselves and my stepmother treats the other girls nice and taking parties and Cinderella had a scrub the floors and and she was a stepmother was harsh and so very good over there comes in the view and helps her out and turns a pumpkin into the chariot and horses and any any way animals and have glass slippers and and she went to the ball and met the prince and she had she was late and the pumpkin turned out turned back in and and horses and men so the prince try to get the youngers women to try on the slipper and the two ugly sisters the feet they they tried to get stick it in their feet to the slipper and so Cinderella had a fit to the slipper and lived that happy ever ever get red bread get the peanut butter and jar and jelly jar and get to know spread on the peanut butter and get a spoon and dig out the jelly and and spoon is on the bread and and it's right.
