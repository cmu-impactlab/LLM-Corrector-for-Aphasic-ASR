not very good that's that's my take on it i can't think i can't say what i want to you know and spelling is just like i had to ask the phone where where whatever her name was to spell guard g u a r d but i couldn't spell it and simple words simple words are i can't think of it and but i if i had look it up in dictionary or light will go off and i won't be able to spell it but to think of it i can't even i still still struggle to text because i can't think of the right spelling not spelling and spelling and word phrase she gets aggravated so yeah well the the initial one i remember we always kiss before we go to bed and well she said that i didn't pucker just you know right here and i said well well over and over again i couldn't i couldn't say just what and i i remember that the ride up to the gas station for the er i remember going in but that was the last thing i remember until i woke up in vanderbilt ambulance i just i was scared because i couldn't communicate and i had a deep depression so i had had to train all over again just to brush my teeth so it was just i guess that surgeon said that you know the cluster of vessels right here and it burst and so i i i wanted to when released me i i wanted to drive but anyway yeah and every time i talk at least if we have to conversation right here and you know the i don't know you and right here i am sweating and i i didn't i didn't do that before the stroke and so just to know that my my glasses fogged up and i am starting to sweat yeah but the my friend if we have to talk lengthy i start to sweat too but just like if i was going to lowe's i mean just just to i think i was i was even i'm embarrassed to communicate because you know i stumble and can't think of the words and so every time i do that sweat yeah so but anyway you know well the speech therapist at tenova but that was i think it was six months so but the insurance cut cut me off no i don't think so was it well it was still a challenge even even though i don't know was it september i got home something like that so it's still had had to learn all over again well she had me read and say say the dumbest things over and over and over well i don't know just the five you know four four words over and over again then five four i mean six talking she said it and then i said well the the sentence and and i had to repeat i don't know do that i do my my dad was a preacher and she he went to flint michigan from florence alabama and in january of sixty seven and where she he preached that her parents was converted and so i seeked her out but well i was in henderson tennessee going to freed hardeman college and it was a college there then it's not now it's a university but the she was still in flint michigan so that had a long distance relationship so and i started out preaching and but but her dad was in general motors he was a grinder skilled trades and he said that the shops were hiring but the shops weren't hiring as well as he thought and we went up there in january of seventy three and and i got out in july thirty first so but that was a good move because we had retirement and the general motors stopped that retirement in probably o seven or o eight and i retired in o three that was a good move i just didn't want to be like my dad because preachers don't you have you don't have a retirement you go to work or you die and if they don't have benefits and so you could had to probably hold down two jobs for benefits so i just i decided not to go along those lines i am thankful so and and the bill for brain surgery was half a million and we only paid just over one thousand dollars well but medicare and blue cross you know yeah medicare and blue cross paid for that yeah if i had had to be a preacher is going that's right my glasses are fogging up i may make myself nervous well what do you mean tell you a story the boy's kicking the ball and it goes through the window and he lands on his father and his father throws it back at him or or you going to discipline him yes no well first one pictures probably the child don't want the umbrella and mama said that you need the umbrella and probably they said the child you don't need one so he goes out in the rain and he gets wet and goes back and gets the umbrella so he can get dry well there's probably a little girl and the cat and the dog chased him up the tree and dad got up on the tree and he lost his ladder and he's probably doesn't afraid to drop get down and the firemen had to be called to get the dad and the cat down i can't probably get the words out cinderella's i don't know if his mother or stepmother or two sisters are they're ugly and cinderella is beautiful so but they're into themselves and my stepmother treats the other girls nice and taking parties and cinderella had to scrub the floors and she was a stepmother was harsh and so very godmother comes in the view and helps her out and turns a pumpkin into the chariot and horses and anyway animals and have glass slippers and she went to the ball and met the prince and she was late and the pumpkin turned back in and horses and men so the prince tried to get the younger women to try on the slipper and the two ugly sisters the feet they they tried to get stick it in their feet to the slipper and so cinderella had a fit to the slipper and lived at happy ever after get the bread get the peanut butter and jar and jelly jar and get the knife spread on the peanut butter and get a spoon and dig out the jelly and spoon it on the bread and eat it
