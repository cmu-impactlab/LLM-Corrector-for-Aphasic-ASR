not very good thats my take on it I cant say what I want to yep and spelling is just like I had to ask oh oh shoot the phone whatever her name is Siri to spell guard g u a r d but I couldnt spell it and simple words simple words are I cant think of it but if I look it up in dictionary or light will go off and I will be able to spell it but to think of it I cant I still struggle to text because I cant think of the right spelling spelling and word phrase so she gets aggravated so oh yeah well the initial one we always kiss before we go to bed well she said that I did a pucker is just you know right here and I said well well over and over again I couldnt say just well and I remember the ride up to the gas station for the e r Tenova I remember going in but that was last thing I ever remember until I woke up in Vanderbilt ambulance I just I was scared because I couldnt communicate and I had a deep depression so and I had to train all over again just to brush my teeth so yeah I guess that surgeon said that you know the cluster of vessels right here and it burst and so that but I wanted to when released me I wanted to drive but anyway yeah and every time I talk least at if were conversation right here you know the I dont know you and right here I am sweating and I didnt do that before the stroke so just to know that my glasses fogged up and I am starting to sweat yep but my friend if we have to talk lengthy I start to sweat too but just like if I was going to Lowes I mean I mean its just to I think I was even Im embarrassed to communicate because you know I stumble and cant think of the words and so every time I do that sweat gets so but anyway you know I do well the speech therapist at Tenova I think it was six months but the insurance cut me off so no I dont think so was that well it was still a challenge even though got I dont know was it September I got home something like that so still had to learn all over again yeah I dont know where well she had me read and say the dumbest things over and over and over but was I dont know just five you know four words over and over again and then five four I mean six whatever talking she said it and then I said it well that sentence and I had to repeat I dont know do what I my dad was a preacher and she not she he went to Flint Michigan from Florence Alabama and in January of sixty seven where he preached at her parents were converted and so I seeked her out well I was in Henderson Tennessee going to Freed Hardeman college and that was a college there then now its a university she was still in Flint Michigan so that had a long distance relationship so then I started out preaching but her dad was in General Motors and he was a grinder a skill trades and he said that the shops were hiring but the shops werent hiring as well as he thought and we took we went all up there in January of seventy three and I get out in July thirty first of seventy three but that was a good move because we had retirement and the General Motors stopped that retirement in probably o seven or o eight and I retired in o three so that was a good move yeah but I just didnt want to be like my dad because preachers dont have a retirement you go to work and you die and they dont have benefits and so I had to hold down two jobs for benefits so I decided not go along those lines and I am thankful so and the bill for brain surgery it was half a million and we only paid just over a thousand dollars but Medicaid and Blue Cross you know paid huh oh yeah yeah Medicare and Blue Cross paid for that yep yeah if I had to be a preacher its going thats right my glasses are fogging up Im making myself nervous okay well what do you mean tell you a story the boys kicking the ball and it goes through the window and it lands on his father and his father throws it back at him or or he gonna discipline him oh yes oh well no well first one the pictures probably a child dont want the umbrella and mama said that you need a umbrella and probably they said the child you dont need one so he goes out in the rain and he gets wet and goes back gets the umbrella so he could get dry oh yes well probably the little girl had the cat and the dog chased him up the tree and dad got up on the tree and he lost his ladder and hes probably afraid to get down and the firemen had to be called to get the dad and the cat down yeah I was somewhat mad I cant probably get the words out Cinderellas I dont know if it was mother or stepmother or anyway two sisters or theyre ugly and Cinderellas beautiful too but they are into themselves and the stepmother treats the other girls nice and take them parties and Cinderella had to scrub the floors she was stepmother was harsh so fairy godmother there comes in the view and helps her out and turns a pumpkin into the chariot and horses and anyway animals and have glass slippers and she went to the ball and met the prince and she was late and the pumpkin turned out turned back in and the horses and the men so the prince tried to get the younger women to try on the slipper and the two ugly sisters the feet they tried to stick it in their feet to the slipper so Cinderella had a fit to the slipper and lived happily after so get bread get the peanut butter jar and jelly jar and get the knife and spread on the peanut butter and get a spoon and dig out the jelly and the spoon is on the bread and eat it thats right
