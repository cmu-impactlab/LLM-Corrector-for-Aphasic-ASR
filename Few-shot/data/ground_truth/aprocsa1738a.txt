okay very erratic Im close to ten years since the stroke and Ive been more or less talking for the last seven and at times this tenth year I can wake up and feel fine and pronounce things very carefully other the times Im off in the fall somewhere about back and forth more than of these past years so anything else yeah its late in December I was alone in my small house behind my a friend with my daughters and I suddenly went I would say at this point Ill say blank but going back as far beyond this I couldnt get a hold of myself and I was in the house it was very cold its very messy and I sat there from somewhere between two and three days eventually my daughter came in so yeah it was very long I couldnt move I feel very more or less blessed by my recovery because I got up and moved eventually months later I couldnt walk for about I think three or four months but Im have been doing the things I was asked to do and I read and I write and I draw and I walk a deal and Im doing yoga at this point about two or three times a week oh okay you look breathe brightly yeah well one on one therapy just sit down and not exactly its more or less being connected to a aphasia Ive been in group but occasionally for two or three months at a time one on one so okay just totally at random okay theres so many different things are important to me I dont know really what to draw from the every week is I experience them several things that are really mind bogglingly important so okay currently Ive think Im very concerned about the national political mood in this country and Im working Im concentrated on something that I can do on a daily basis that takes the president out of office and also Im praying and talking with every people about it so thats very current and very important at the moment so yeah not too many trips lately Ive been thinking about it a great deal I am maybe hoping to return to California if another maybe one to two years so where Im new no Media and Palos Verdes right near Redonda Beach yeah okay by the way Redonda is among almost my favorite beach long ago theres three or four thats tied Redonda in Ill think about it well its second place so I have to think about it its long ago okay it used to be very wide I havent been there for a while so yeah yeah Its since first cousin living on the beach in Hermosa Beach so okay well the boy is kicking the ball its going through the window its dropping next to a young an older man who grabs it close thats the basic okay Ive been very busy lately the young boy is has no umbrella from the mother he says goodbye goes out and it starts raining he runs back is all wet the mother look at him a bit scoldingly so he takes the umbrella and he walks to school I guess end of the story okay okay okay and very basically the little girl is trying to reach the kittycat in the branches theres a ladder and tricycle next to her closer to the tree theres a forlorn looking man looking out as the dog barks up at him and the two firemen are running with another ladder from the firetruck to presumably put the ladder up and rescue the man and theres a bird sitting up and singing to the heavens end of the story was trying close yeah the basics yeah okay okay okay okay simply put Cinderella was alarmingly pretty and good natured and in the servitude of an evil stepmother and two stepdaughters stepsisters and really want the whole story right okay I got to keep awake but Ill try so theres a ball and the mother and the sisters are very worked up about the whole thing and are gonna try on the best costumes Cinderella was also worked up but she is going to be the mother is going to order to sit in the house and clean so off the mother stepsisters go and Cinderella is very forlorn but all the household critters are gathered and send her off in a fancy gown and I think its a whats the word a good fairy appears to her and becomes a mushroom sorry the pumpkin into a carriage and off she goes to the ball and naturally he is she is the first one of all and various courtiers have told her that he has to return at midnight so she has a great time dancing with the prince who is totally in love with her now but the clock strikes ten sorry twelve and she runs out the door and leaves one shoe in hall of the entrance and he gets a carriage and rides home and the carriage is carrying back into a pumpkin and her gorgeous gown turns the old rags and he returns to the day to day chores and theres a back and forth about the wicked stepmother and the stepsisters try to dress up and present themselves to the princes emissaries but I forget all the little details but she appears at the nick of time and the emissary puts the magic shoe on her and everything is hunky dory thats about it okay again and again I watched the whole damn thing for a little like its in my brain forever yes too bad of course okay go on yeah thats alright Ill get bread sorry wheat bread and put the jelly peanut butter on one side of the bread and the hopefully apricot jelly on the other side together and eat it yes
