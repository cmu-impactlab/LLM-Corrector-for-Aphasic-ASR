Yeah, they, they was a lot, I didn't, I didn't mention the bird, I just, he's just sitting there looking, he can't, that's all he was gonna do. Um, mhm, mhm. Okay. It's, it's a story about Cinderella. He, he had her, I mean, his daddy was, uh, uh, widow because his wife died, and he, she was very neat and pretty when she was a little girl, and then then his mother, his daddy said, I'm going to marry this woman, she was a, a very treacherous woman, and, and she wanted to marry him, so he they, they married, and he, she had two little girls, very, um, very, very ugly girls, and, and so, then the the daddy died, and all she said, she was gonna run the house, and she didn't want, uh, Cinderella to have pretty clothes, she will, she wanted her to have rags, and then she said, I don't have a, a, a, uh, uh, a maid to run this house, so you will be the maid, and you will, be my, my, my, maid, and the girls, too. And then by this time, they had grown up, and so she, she, uh, uh, fixed the the, uh, uh, the, the, uh, fixed the, the, um, that's, um, the wood, the fire, and did a house work and cooked the breakfast and stuff for them, anything they wanted, she had to do it. And so she left, lived up in the attic, and in, and when she had the animals to talk to her, the horse and the, the rats and and the, uh, cat and things, that's all she had to talk to. And then a, a, uh, a telegram came because the king wants her, his son to marry. So he had a, a ball, and so he, they trying to see who he want to marry.
