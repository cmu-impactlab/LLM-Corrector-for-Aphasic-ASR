not pretty good. that's that's my take on it. I can't think I can't um say what I want to. Yeah, and spelling is um just like I had to um S.O. I should ask it the uh um the phone where we're whatever her name was to uh spell guard, g u a r d. But I couldn't spell and uh simple words, simple words are I can't think of it. and but I uh um if I had um look up a dictionary or um it light would go off and uh um I would be able to spell it. But uh but to think of it I can't. Even um I still still struggled to text because I can't think of the um right uh um spelling, not spelling it spelling and and uh um word phrase so, um she would gets aggravated. Oh yeah. Well, the the initial one, I remember um we always kissed before we uh go to bed and uh um well, she said um that I didn't uh pucker. He just, you know, right here. And uh um and I said, um, well, well, over and over again. I could I couldn't I couldn't say. Just and uh uh and I I remember the ride up to the uh gas station uh for the ER. and I remember going in, but that was the last thing I remember until I woke up in Vanderbilt, ambulance. I just uh um I was scared because uh I couldn't communicate and I just had a deep depression. So and I had had to train all over again just to brush my teeth. So um it was just um I guess that the surgeon said that you know, the um the cluster of uh vessels right here and uh um it burst and so I I I wanted to when released me, I I wanted to drive. But anyway. Yeah, and uh um every time um I talk least if we could conversation right here, any you know, um um the I don't know you and right here, I am sweating and I I didn't I didn't do that before the stroke and uh and I I'm starting to sweat. Yep. my uh but the um my friend uh if if we have to talk uh lengthy, I I start to to sweat too. But uh just like uh if I was going to Lowe's, I mean I mean, just just to I think I I'm embar I was I was even I'm embarrassed uh to communicate because, you know, I stumble and and uh can't think of the words and and so every time I do that, sweat yeah. So, but anyway. Yeah. Well, the uh speech therapist at Nova but uh that was uh I think it was six months, so but uh the insurance cut cut me off. Um I don't think so was that? Well, it was still a challenge, eve- even though uh um got well, I don't know, was it September, I got home, something like that. So, it's still um had had to learn all over again. I don't work. Yeah. Um well, she had had me read and the um say say the dumbest things over and over and over. Was I don't know, just the uh uh five, you know, four uh four words over and over again. N five, four, I mean, six, talking. She said it and then I say. Well, the the that that sentence and and I had to uh uh um repeat. I don't know, do what? I had to my uh my dad was a preacher and she uh not she he um went to uh um Flint Michigan uh from um um Florence, Alabama. And uh um uh in January of '67. And uh um we're uh she uh he preached at her parents uh was converted and uh um um so I I I seeked her out. but anyway. Well, I was in Henderson, Tennessee uh going to uh Freed Hardeman College and that was a college there then. It's not now, it's a university. but um the uh she was still in Flint, Michigan. So that had a long distance relationship. So um I started out preaching and uh um but uh um but her dad was a um uh in General Motors and he was a um grinder, a skilled trades and uh he said that the shops were hiring. But uh the shop he uh the shops weren't hiring as what he uh he thought and uh um we took uh we went up there in January of '73 and uh um and uh and I got out in July uh 31st. So but uh that was a good move because uh um we had uh retirement and uh um uh the General Motors stopped that uh retirement in uh um probably uh 07 or 08 and I retired in uh 03. So it was a a good move. I just didn't want to uh uh be uh like my dad because uh um preachers all don't um you have you don't have a retirement. You go to work and you die. And if if the uh um they don't have a um uh benefits and uh so you could had had to uh probably hold down two jobs for benefits. So uh I just uh um I decided not to uh go all on that those lines. I am thankful. So and and the bill for the surgery was half a million and the uh um we we only paid uh just over $1,000. Well, but Medicare and um Blue Cross, you know. Yeah. Medicare and Blue Cross paid for that. Yeah. If I had had it be a preacher is going that's right. My my glasses are fogging up. I'm making making myself nervous. Well, what what do you mean tell you a story? the boy's kicking the ball and and it goes through uh the uh window and he lands on his father and his father throws it back at him. Or or he going to discipline him. Yes. Well, no. Well, first one picture is uh probably um um the child uh um don't want uh um um the umbrella and mom said that uh you need to um umbrella and uh probably they said the child you don't uh need one. So he uh he goes out in the rain and he he gets wet and uh um goes back and gets the uh um the umbrella so he can get dry. Really good. Well, this probably the little girl had a um the cat and the dog chased him up the tree and dad uh got up on the tree and he lost his ladder and uh and he's probably doesn't need uh afraid to the drop uh get down and farmer had be called to get the dad and the cat down. Yeah, somewhat. Yeah, I don't know about that. I can't um I can't um probably get the words out. Cinderella's I don't know if it was mother or or stepmother are anyway two uh two sisters are they're ugly and uh and Cinderella's beautiful. So but they're into themselves and uh um um so um a stepmother treats the other girls nice and uh um take them to parties and Cinderella had a uh um scrub the floors and uh um and she was uh stepmother was harsh and um and so um very God mother comes into view and uh helps her out and turns a pumpkin into the chariot and uh um um horses and and anyway animals and have glass slippers and and uh um she went to the ball and met the prince and uh um uh she uh she was late and the pumpkin uh turned out turned back in and and the horses and the men. So uh so the prince uh tried to get the uh um younger uh women to uh um try on the slipper and uh um the uh two ugly uh sisters, the um the feet they they tried to uh get stick it in their feet to the slipper and uh um so Cinderella um um had fit uh to the slipper and lived at happily ever after. Um get the bread, get the uh the peanut butter and jar and jelly uh um jelly jar and uh um get the knife and spread on the uh um peanut butter and get a spoon and um um dig out the uh jelly and and uh um spoon it on the uh bread and and eat it.
