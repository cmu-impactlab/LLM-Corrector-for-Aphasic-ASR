Not pretty good thats thats my take on it I cant think I cant say what I want to and spelling is just like I had to ask oh ask it the the phone where it were whatever her name it was to spell guard GUARD but I couldnt spell and simple words simple words or I cant think of it and but I if I had look it up in dictionary or it light will go off and I wont be able to spell it but but to think of it I cant even I still still struggle to text because I cant think of the right spelling not spelling spelling and and word phrase so she gets aggravated so yeah well the the initial one I remember we always kissed before we go to bed and well shes said that I did pucker is just you know right here and and I said well well over it and over it again I couldnt I couldnt say just well and now I remember that the ride up to the gas station for the ER that I wouldnt remember going in but that was the last thing I remember until I woke up in Vanderbilt ambulance I just I was scared because I couldnt communicate and I had a deep depression so and I had had to train all over again just to brush my teeth so it was just I guess that surgeon said that you know they cluster of vessels right here and it burst and so that I I I wanted to when released me I I wanted to drive but anyway yeah and every time I talk at least if were a conversation right here and you know the the I dont know you and right here I am sweating and I dont I didnt I didnt do that before the stroke and so just to know that my my glasses fogged up and I am starting to sweat but the my friend if we have to talk a lengthy I started to sweat too but just like if I was going to Lowes I mean just just to I think I was embarrassed I was even Im embarrassed to communicate because you know I stumble and and cant think the words and so every time I do that sweat gets home but anyway you know well the speech therapist at to Nova but that was I think it was six months so but insurance cut cut me off I dont think so was that well it was still a challenge even even though got I dont know is it September I got home something like that so its still had had to learn all over again I dont work yeah well she had me read and and say say the dumbest things over and over and over was I dont know just that five you know 44 words over and over again and five for having sex talking she said it and then I swelled the that sentence and and I had to repeat I dont know do that I do my my dad was a preacher and she not she he went to Flint MI from Florence AL and in January of 607 and where she he preached at her parents was converted and so I I seeked her out but well I was in Henderson TN going to free hardeman college and it was a college there then its not now its the university but the she was still in Flint MI so that had a long distance relationship so and I I started out preaching and but but her dad was in General Motors and he was a grinder skilled trades and he said that the shops were hiring but the shop he the sharps werent hiring as well as he he thought and we took we went out up there in January of 73 and and and I get out in July 31st so but that was a good move because we had retirement and the jitter motors stopped that retirement in probably OO7 or O8 and I retired in O3 that was a good move I just didnt want to be like my dad because preachers dont you have you dont have a retirement you go to work and you die and if if they they dont have a benefits and so you could have had had to probably hold down to jobs for benefits so I just I decided not to go along like those lines I am thankful so and and and the bill bring surgery has happened me and and the we we only paid just over $1000 but Medicaid and Blue Cross you know Oh yeah Medicare and Blue Cross paid for that if I had had it be a preacher hes going thats right my glasses are fogging out Im made make myself nervous well what do you mean to tell you stories the boys kicking the ball and and it goes through the window and he lends on his father and his father throws him back and he or or he going to discipline him yes well no first one pictures probably the child dont want to the umbrella and Mama said that you need an umbrella and probably they said the child you dont need one so he he goes out in the ring and he he gets wet and goes back and gets the umbrella so should he going to get dry really good well this probably the little girl had the cat and the dog chased him up the tree and dad got up on the tree and he lost his ladder and hes done probably done afraid to the drop get down and the firemen had to be called to get the dad and the cat down yeah somewhat yeah but I cant probably get the words out cinderellas I dont know if his mother or stepmother or anywhere 2 two sisters or theyre ugly and and cinderellas beautiful so but they are into themselves and my stepmother treats the other girls nice and taking parties and Cinderella had the scrub the floors and and she was a stepmother who was harsh and so very good my brother comes in the view and helps her out and turns a pumpkin into the chariot and horses and any any way animals and have glass slippers and and she went to the ball and met the Prince and she had she was late in the pumpkin turned out turned back in and and horses and men so the Prince tried to get the youngers women to try on the slipper and the two ugly sisters the the feet they tried to get stick it in their feet to the slipper and so Cinderella had had a fit to the slipper and lived that happily ever ever give bread bread get the peanut butter and jar and jell Jelly jar and get the knife spread on the peanut butter and get a spoon and dig out the Jelly and and spoon is on the bread and and eat it thats right
