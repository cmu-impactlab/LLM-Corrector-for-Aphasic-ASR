Not very good. That's, that's my take on it. I can't think. I can't, um, say what I want to, you know? And spelling is tre- um... Just like I had to ask oh... Shoo. Ask it, uh, um, the phone, wh- wh- whatever her name it was to, uh, spell guard, G-U-A-R-D. But I couldn't spell it. And, uh, simple words. Simple words. Simple words are... I can't think of it. And... But I, uh, uh... If I had, um, look it up in dictionary or, um... It... Light will go off and, uh, um, I won't be all able to spell it. But, uh, but to think of it, I can't... Even, uh, I still str- still struggle to text 'cause I can't think of the w- uh, right, uh, um, spelling. Mm-hmm. Not spelling. Uh, spelling and and, uh, uh, word phrase, so. Uh, she gets aggravated. So, yeah. Well, well, the, the initial one, I remember, um, we always kiss before we, uh, go to bed. And, uh, uh... Well, sh- she said, uh, that I did bu- uh, pucker. It's just, you know, right here. And, uh, um, and I said, um, "Well, well." Uh, over, over it again. I couldn't, I couldn't say just "well". And, uh, uh... Now, I, I remember that, uh, the ride up to the, uh, gas station, uh, for the ER. Mm-hmm. So, I went... I remember going in, but that was the last thing I remember. Mm-hmm. Until I woke up th- in Vanderbilt ambulance. I just, uh... I was scared because, uh, I couldn't communicate. And I had a deep depression, so. I had to, had to train all over again just to brush my teeth, so. Um, it was just, um... I guess that surgeon said that, you know, the, um, the cluster of, uh, vessels right here, and, uh, um, it burst and... So, that... I, I wa- I wanted to... When d- when they released me, I, I wanted to drive. But, anyway. Yeah, and, uh, uh, every time, um, I talk, at least if we're con- conversation right here, and, you know, um, the, um... The... I don't know you. And right here, I am sweating. And I don't... I didn't, I didn't do that before the stroke. And, uh... So, just to know that my f- my glasses fogged up, and, uh, I, I am starting to sweat. Yup. My, uh... But, eh, the, um, my friend, uh, if, if we had... could talk, uh, uh, lengthy, I, I started to s- sweat too. But, uh, just like, uh, if I was going to Lowe's, I mean... Pshh. I mean, it... Just, just to... I think, um, I was embarr- I was... Even I'm embarrassed, uh, to communicate because, you know, I stumble and, and, uh, can't think of the words. And, and... So, every time I do that, sweat gets on, but anyway. Yeah. Right. Well, the, uh, speech therapist at Tenova. But, uh, that was, uh, I think it was six months, so. But, uh, the insurance cut, cut me off. Um, I don't think so. Was that... Uh, it was still a challenge even, even though, uh, w- got... Uh, I don't know. Was it September I got home? Something like that. So, uh, still had, had to learn all over again. Yeah. I don't remem- Oh, um... Well, she re- ha- uh, had me read and, uh, say s- say the dumbest things over and over and over. It was, I don't know. Just, uh, uh, five, you know, four, uh, four words over and over again. And, uh, then five, four, I mean, six. Mm-hmm. Sure. Talking. She said it and then I s-... Well, the, th- that sentence. And, and I had to, uh, um, repeat. I don't know. Do what? Where have you... I do... My, uh, my dad was a preacher. And she, uh... No, she... He, um, went to, uh-... Flint, Michigan from, uh, Florence, Alabama. And, uh, uh, in January of '67. And, uh, where, uh, she, uh, he preached at her parents', uh, was converted end, uh. Um, so I, I s- seeked her out but... Well, I was in, uh, Henderson, Tennessee, uh, going to, uh, Freed-Hardeman College and that was a college there then. It's not, now it's a university. But, um, the, uh, she was still in Flint, Michigan so that had a long-distance relationship. Mm. So and I, I started out preaching and, uh, but, uh, um, but her dad was a, um, in General Motors and he was a, um, grinder, a skilled trades. And, uh, he said that the shops were hiring but, uh, the shop, he, uh, the shops weren't hiring as well as he, uh, he thought. And, uh, we took, uh, we went all up there in January of '73 and, uh, and, uh, and I got in July, uh, 31st, so. But, uh, that was a good move because, uh, uh, we had, uh, retirement and, uh, um, the General Motors stopped that, uh, retirement in probably '0-, uh, '07 or '08 and I retired in, uh, '03. That was a, a good move. I just didn't want to, uh, uh, be, uh, like my dad because, uh, um, preachers d- all don't, um, you have t- uh, don't have a retirement because work or you die. And if, if they, uh, uh, they don't have, uh, um, benefits and, uh, so you could, ha- had to, uh, probably hold down two jobs for benefits. So, uh, I just, uh, I decided not to go along li- those lines. I am thankful, so. And s- and s- and the bill, brain surgery, that was half of me and, and the, uh, um, we, we only paid, uh, o- just over a thousand dollars. My o- but Medicaid and, um, Blue Cross, you know- Medicare. Huh? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Medicare and Blue Cross paid for that. Yeah. Is that- If I had, had to be a preacher he's going, "Pfft." That's right. My glasses are fogging up. I'm ma- making myself nervous. Well... What do you mean tell you a story? The boy's k- kicking the ball and, and it goes through a, the, uh, window and he lands on his father and his father throws it back at him. Or, or he's gonna discipline him. Yeah. Yes. Well, no. Well, first one picture was a probably, um, child, uh, uh, don't want, uh, uh, the umbrella and mama said that, uh, "You need a, uh, umbrella." And, uh, probably they said, the child, "You don't, uh, need one." So he, uh, he goes out in the rain and he's, he gets wet and, uh, goes back and gets the, uh, the umbrella so's he could get dry. Really good. Well, this, uh, probably the little girl had, uh, um, a cat and the dog chased him up the tree and dad, uh, got up on the tree and he lost his ladder and, uh, and he's d- probably doesn't, afraid to drop, uh, get down and the firemen had to be called to get the dad and the cat down. Yeah, it was somewhat, yeah, I don't know about that. I can't, um... Probably the, get the words out. Mm. Cinderella's, I don't know if it was mother or step-mother or... Anyway, two, uh, two sisters or they were ugly and, uh, and Cinderella's beautiful so. But they are into themselves and, uh, um... Uh, the step-mother treats the other girls nice and, uh-... taken to parties. And Cinderella had to, uh, uh, scrub the floors and um, eh, th- she was a stepmother who was harsh. And um, uh, so fairy godmother comes into view and helps her out and turns a pumpkin into the chariot and uh, uh, horses and any- any way animals and had glass slippers. And, and uh, she went to the ball and met the prince and uh, uh, she had- she was late and the pumpkin, uh, turned out- turned back in and the horses, uh, and the men. So, uh, uh, the prince, uh, tried to get the, uh, y- youngers, uh, women to, uh, uh, try on the slipper. And uh, uh, the, uh, two ugly s- uh, sisters, the, um, the feet they- they tried to, uh, get stick it in their feet to the slipper. And uh, so Cinderella, um, had- had to fit, uh, to the slipper and lived happy la- ev- ever. Uh, get red- bread, get the, uh, peanut butter in jar and jel- uh, jelly jar. And, uh, get the knife and spread on the, uh, uh, peanut butter and get a spoon. And, um, dig out the, uh, jelly and, and spoon it on the, uh, bread and, and eat it. That's right.
